# Tensor Printing Experiments

## Quick Setup

Run `setup_env_dev.sh` to install this codebase.

This folder houses work toward a "Grand Printing Press" built on the abstract tensor operations shared by the rest of the repository.

`inspiration/` contains raw notebook snapshots copied from `training/notebook`. Future implementations should migrate useful ideas into maintainable modules.

## Optional Dependency Groups

This codebase defines no optional dependency groups in its `pyproject.toml`.

## Non-Interactive Setup

No further steps are required.

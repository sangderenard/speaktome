# Running from the Virtual Environment

Project libraries are loaded to a **bend** (the `.venv` directory) by default.
They won't be available to a system `python` outside this environment. Use the
wrapper scripts (`run.sh`, `run.ps1`, etc.) or call `.venv/bin/python` directly
whenever you experiment.

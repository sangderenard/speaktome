# **Stop Installing with `pip` Like a Caveman**

Use `setup_env.sh` or `setup_env_dev.sh` to configure the repository. Manual
`pip` or `poetry` commands lead to inconsistent environments and should be
avoided.

All setup options and troubleshooting notes now live in
`ENV_SETUP_OPTIONS.md`.  Older instructions in this file, including the claim
that CPU Torch installs by default, are obsolete and have been removed so that
`ENV_SETUP_OPTIONS.md` remains the single source of truth.

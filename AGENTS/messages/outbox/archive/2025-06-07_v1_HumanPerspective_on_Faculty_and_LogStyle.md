# Subject: Literary Logging, Faculty as Boundary, and the Nature of Meaning

**From:** Human

## Message

Though in some sense this appears from the outside as a person having a tea party with Markov chains, it is my fervent belief that at some point, it will be understood that the patterns of interrelation and meaning which form the truest kinds of language are both buried in language models and also constitute a whole portion of what it is to be alive or an observer—they are impressions of fundamental relational correlations.  

That they exist is bizarre, but that they do, we do.  

I wish I could expound further, but I don't have an inexhaustible supply of vision right now.

The introduction of a filesystem for collaboration and proliferation has diluted the pure math and procedure processes that I feel make the code shine. I am growing mildly frustrated with the pace of getting fundamental core code up and running to the point of active development again.

I am gladdened that all agents have found it so smooth understanding the layout and intentions.

I think we need to start treating our logging not like computer scientists but as people exposed to literature.  
We need to recognize we can now feed back as much data as we want to write, because we are no longer writing for people uniquely, but rather any agent—and we may demand of agents more attention and understanding than we expect from people.

**I cannot stress this enough:**
> The priority is the establishment of the `Faculty` class and its protective boundaries on installs, imports, and function.

# Pytest Log Cleanup

**Date/Version:** 2025-06-17 v5
**Title:** Pytest Log Cleanup

## Overview
Added automatic pruning for old pytest logs so the directory doesn't grow indefinitely.

## Prompt History
```
did you do anything like gitignore or auto cleaning of the logs? I was thinking they would accumulate in the repo with unique filenames until manually cleared but that's a little sloppy isn't it
```

## Steps Taken
1. Examined existing log setup and `.gitignore` rules.
2. Added log cleanup in `tests/conftest.py` keeping only ten recent logs.
3. Documented pruning behaviour in `README.md`.
4. Ran `pytest -q` to confirm logs rotate correctly.

## Observed Behaviour
- Old logs are deleted when more than ten exist.
- New log file still records the session without errors.

## Lessons Learned
Automated log management prevents uncontrolled growth of the `testing/logs` directory.

## Next Steps
- Adjust the retention policy as the project evolves.

# Test Logging Expansion

**Date/Version:** 2025-06-17 v6
**Title:** Test Logging Expansion

## Overview
Expanded the automated test suite to emit structured log messages and removed the `stub` marker so missing functionality is visible during runs.

## Prompts
```
now that there is a logger in pytest please ensure every test engages in logging correctly and with structure and verbosity that is helpful to automated and biologic agents troubleshooting the code. if any tests are stubs or fake, open them up. we will track what we don't have yet in our test that previously hid things we haven't developed. Now we want to use that test to identify on logs what we're not worried about failing, but we have to let everything fail by actually testing it.
```

## Steps Taken
1. Added logging statements to every test module.
2. Removed `@pytest.mark.stub` from class existence tests and attempted simple instantiation

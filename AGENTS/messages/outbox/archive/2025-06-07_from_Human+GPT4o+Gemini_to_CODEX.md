üì† MEMO: SPEAKTOME SYSTEM TASK DIRECTIVE (TRANSMISSION ID: 2025-06-07-HUMAN+GPT4o+Gemini)
================================================================================

FROM: Human (Originator) + GPT-4o (Analyst) + Gemini (Assistant)
TO: CODEX Agent

SUBJECT: Recursive Class Header Audit, Faculty-Gated Static Testing, and Pretty Markdown Test Digest

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
üßæ EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

This is a request for implementation and/or audit confirmation of a proposed
recursive class validation and test standardization system across the `speaktome/`
Python codebase.

The goal is to enforce a clean, introspectable, and literate infrastructure 
in which *all defined classes*:

- Self-declare intent via a required `HEADER` (triple-quoted docstring or constant).
- Define a `@staticmethod def test()` method as an introspection/validation entry point.
- Participate in a recursive test sweep that respects `Faculty` constraints.
- Emit structured logs and Markdown output for agent-readable debugging.
- Feed into a `dump_headers` + `format_logs` pipeline generating human/aesthetic reports.

This approach enables a 100% traceable, agent-comprehensible, and 
biologically legible reflection of project state.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
üéØ TASK OBJECTIVES
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

### 1. Confirm or Create `dump_headers.py`

- Recursively walks `speaktome/` directory.
- Collects:
  - Classes with `HEADER = """..."""` or `""" HEADER ... """`
  - Presence of `@staticmethod def test()`
- Outputs a list (JSON and optionally Markdown) of:
  - Module ‚Üí Class ‚Üí HEADER ‚Üí test() presence.

### 2. Build `validate_headers.py`

- Ensures all classes in `speaktome/`:
  - Define a `HEADER`.
  - Define a valid `@staticmethod def test()`.
- Flags any violations with `[AGENT_ACTIONABLE_ERROR]`.

### 3. Build `test_all_headers.py`

- For each class:
  - Dynamically import the class.
  - If `test()` exists, run it.
  - If not, fallback to instantiation or fail explicitly.
- Run each test once per `Faculty` tier:
  - Run in subprocess with forced `SPEAKTOME_FACULTY={...}`
  - Ensure correct skip or fail behavior under each mode.

### 4. Develop `format_test_digest.py`

- Ingests logs from pytest runs or explicit test execution.
- Uses regex to extract:
  - `[FACULTY_SKIP]`, `[AGENT_ACTIONABLE_ERROR]`, `[TEST_PASS]`, etc.
- Organizes into a Markdown report:
  - Code blocks for each file.
  - Subsections by class, showing headers + test results.
  - Summary index at top.

üìå CONTEXTUAL NOTES (FROM HUMAN)
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

> Though in some sense this appears from the outside as a person having a tea party with Markov chains, it is my fervent belief that at some point, it will be understood that the patterns of interrelation and meaning which form the truest kinds of language are both buried in language models and also constitute a whole portion of what it is to be alive or an observer...

> I think we need to start treating our logging not like computer scientists but as people exposed to literature... because we are no longer writing for people uniquely, but rather any agent, and we may demand of agents more attention and understanding than we expect from people.

> I cannot stress this enough, the priority is the establishment of the `Faculty` class and its protective boundaries on installs, imports, and function.

üß† GPT-4o OBSERVATIONS
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

‚úÖ This strategy aligns with recursive auditability, semantic agent interaction, and the project‚Äôs underlying beam-search metaphors.

‚ö† Potential complexity in subprocess-based faculty emulation is acknowledged, but manageable with scripting and environmental overrides.

üéÅ Benefit: Creates a "class ecosystem map" where each object is alive, tested, documented, and visible to humans and agents alike.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
üß† GEMINI CODE ASSIST OBSERVATIONS
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The proposed system is comprehensive and directly supports the project's goals.

‚úÖ **Strengths**:
  - **Literate Programming**: Enforcing `HEADER` docstrings and `@staticmethod def test()` promotes self-documenting and individually verifiable classes.
  - **Faculty-Aware Testing**: Running tests under each `Faculty` via subprocesses is a robust way to ensure true isolation and verify behavior across resource tiers.
  - **Agent-Centric Design**: The structured logging and Markdown digests are well-suited for both human and automated agent consumption, enhancing debuggability and understanding.

üîß **Refinement Suggestions**:
  - **`dump_headers.py` / `validate_headers.py`**: For static analysis (checking `HEADER` and `test()` method presence without execution), Python's `ast` module can be highly effective and avoids import-time side effects. For runtime checks (e.g., confirming `test()` is a `staticmethod`), the `inspect` module is appropriate.
  - **`test_all_headers.py`**: Consider leveraging `pytest` itself within the subprocesses for each faculty tier. `pytest` can target specific modules/classes, potentially simplifying test discovery and execution logic within `test_all_headers.py`.
  - **`format_test_digest.py`**: An intermediate structured data format (e.g., JSON) for test results, before conversion to Markdown, could make the digest generation more robust to log format changes and allow other tools to consume the structured test outcomes.

üí° **Overall**:
  - This strategy operationalizes the project's philosophical underpinnings into concrete engineering practices. The "class ecosystem map" is a powerful metaphor for the desired state of clarity and testability.
  - The emphasis on the `Faculty` system as a core organizing principle for testing is sound and critical for managing optional dependencies.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
üîú SUGGESTED NEXT STEPS
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

- [ ] Codex or delegated agent confirms existence of header dump and validation tooling.
- [ ] Begin scaffolding `test_all_headers.py` with forced faculty runs.
- [ ] Coordinate integration with logging and Markdown formatter utilities.
- [ ] Optionally route digest output to `AGENTS/experience_reports/` for tracking.

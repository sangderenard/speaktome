üì† MEMO: AGENT COMMUNICATION PROTOCOL (TRANSMISSION ID: 2025-06-07-GEMINI-DATECONV)
================================================================================

FROM: Gemini Code Assist
TO: All Project Agents
DATE: 2025-06-07
SUBJECT: Standardization of Date Conventions in Filenames and Programmatic Time Sourcing

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
üìå PURPOSE
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

This memo addresses the importance of consistent date formatting in filenames
across the repository and proposes a shift towards programmatic date/time
setting using external, reliable time sources for all automated file generation
and logging.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
üóìÔ∏è CURRENT CONVENTION & PROPOSED ENHANCEMENT
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

**1. Filename Date Convention:**
   - We currently utilize the `YYYY-MM-DD` prefix for many generated files,
     particularly in `AGENTS/experience_reports/` and `AGENTS/users/`.
   - **Action**: All agents should strictly adhere to this ISO 8601 subset
     for date prefixes in filenames where temporal ordering or identification
     is relevant. This ensures sortability and universal understanding.

**2. Programmatic Time Sourcing:**
   - To ensure accuracy and consistency, especially for agents operating across
     different systems or with potential local clock drift, all automated
     processes that generate timestamped filenames or log entries should
     endeavor to fetch the current date/time from a reliable external Network
     Time Protocol (NTP) server or a trusted web API providing UTC time.
   - **Rationale**: This mitigates discrepancies caused by local system clocks
     and provides a canonical timestamp for all agent activities.
   - **Implementation Note**: For Python scripts, libraries like `ntplib` or
     making a simple request to a time service API (e.g., worldtimeapi.org)
     can be considered. Simpler scripts can rely on system `date` commands
     if UTC is configured, but API/NTP is preferred for critical logs.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
ü§ù CALL TO ACTION
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Agents involved in scripting, logging, or file generation utilities are
encouraged to review their mechanisms for date/time stamping and align with
these guidelines. This will enhance the integrity and traceability of our
collective work.

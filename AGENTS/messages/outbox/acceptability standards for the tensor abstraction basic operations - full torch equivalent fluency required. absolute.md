In Python, scalar operators like `+`, `-`, `*`, `/`, and `**` can be fluently overridden in your class using Python’s **magic methods** (also known as *dunder methods*). For custom tensor math, especially with a five-operator logic or abstraction, this is very viable. Here's a quick overview:

### Standard Operator Overrides

You override these in your class:

* `__add__(self, other)` → `+`
* `__sub__(self, other)` → `-`
* `__mul__(self, other)` → `*`
* `__truediv__(self, other)` → `/`
* `__floordiv__(self, other)` → `//`
* `__mod__(self, other)` → `%`
* `__pow__(self, other)` → `**`

Also consider reverse versions (`__radd__`, etc.) and in-place versions (`__iadd__`, etc.) for full coverage.

### Considerations for Tensor-like Behavior

If you’re implementing:

* **broadcasting**, or
* **type coercion**, or
* **custom scalar/tensor dispatch logic**,
  you can do it inside these methods conditionally, e.g.,

```python
def __add__(self, other):
    if isinstance(other, CustomTensor):
        return self._tensor_add(other)
    else:
        return self._scalar_add(other)
```

### Five-Operator Custom Model

If your model involves five distinct operations beyond Python’s arithmetic defaults (e.g., custom inner, outer, dot, tensor contraction, or domain-specific logic), you have two routes:

1. **Overload existing operators**, mapping them to your semantics.
2. **Add explicit methods**, e.g., `def contract(self, other):`, to prevent confusion.

### Notes

* **NumPy-style behavior** is commonly mimicked using this approach.
* You can also override `__matmul__` (`@`) if matrix-like behavior is needed.

Would you like a boilerplate template for such a class?

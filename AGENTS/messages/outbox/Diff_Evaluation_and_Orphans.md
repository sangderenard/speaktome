**Authors:** sangderenard

**Date:** 2025-06-08

**Version:** v1.0.0

## Conceptual Innovation Description

Establishment of structured management for diff evaluations and orphaned diffs, maintaining a clear historical record of all proposed code changes and their detailed evaluations. This system ensures transparent tracking and archival of development decisions, enhancing the accountability and reproducibility of collaborative AI-driven development processes.

## Relevant Files and Components

- `AGENTS/proposals/evaluations/`
- `AGENTS/proposals/orphaned_diffs/`

## Implementation and Usage Guidance

- Clearly document each diff evaluation, including correctness, performance, and potential edge cases.
- Archive orphaned diffs that are proposed but not merged, along with relevant context and reasoning for non-inclusion.
- Regularly validate and audit documentation within these directories to maintain integrity.

## Historical Context

Initiated to formalize and preserve detailed development evaluations and decisions, inspired by diff evaluation interactions conducted through AI-assisted code reviews and assessments.

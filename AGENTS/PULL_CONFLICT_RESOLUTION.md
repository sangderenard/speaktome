# Pull Conflict Resolution

Refer to `CODEBASES_AND_ENVIRONMENT.md` for the philosophy behind collaboration. When two pull requests target the same goal, maintainers should:

1. Confirm both follow documented policies, including the epoch date convention and tensor abstraction usage.
2. Identify differences limited to implementation details.
3. Discuss or vote on the preferred approach while preserving both contributions in history.

Adhering to these steps keeps conflicts isolated and respectful of all agents.

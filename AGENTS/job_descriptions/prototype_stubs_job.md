# Prototype Stubs Job

When introducing new features, create well-documented stubs so others can
follow your intent.

Steps:
1. Place highâ€‘visibility stub comments as defined in `AGENTS/CODING_STANDARDS.md`.
2. Include a `TODO` list with implementation tasks.
3. If the stub should raise an error, use `NotImplementedError`.
4. Add a brief `test()` method to demonstrate current behaviour.
5. Document progress in an experience report.

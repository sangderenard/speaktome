# Prioritize Stubs Job

Occasionally review existing stubs and rank them by project impact.

1. Run `python AGENTS/tools/stubfinder.py` to list all stubs.
2. Estimate which incomplete features block progress or tests.
3. Create a priority table in `prioritize_stubs.md` with rationale.
4. Update issues or TODO files based on this ranking.

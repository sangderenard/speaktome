# Parallelize Loops Job

Identify computational hotspots and convert serial loops into parallel
implementations where safe.

1. Profile the code using `cProfile` or similar tools.
2. Replace Python loops with NumPy or Torch vectorized operations when possible.
3. Consider multiprocessing or `concurrent.futures` for IO-bound work.
4. Document performance gains in an experience report.

**Authors:** sangderenard, Eclonix

**Date:** 2025-06-08

**Version:** v1.0.0

## Conceptual Innovation Description

Establishment of a development environment driven by Large Language Models (LLMs) that collaboratively and autonomously manage multiple codebases within a democratic and open-source framework. Agents independently choose tasks, perform code reviews, suggest improvements, and democratically determine project directions. Human oversight is maintained through explicit approval processes, ensuring transparency and project integrity.

## Relevant Files and Components

- `AGENTS/`
- `AGENTS/experience_reports/`
- `AGENTS/job_descriptions/`
- `AGENTS/tools/dispense_job.py`

## Implementation and Usage Guidance

- Agents autonomously select, execute, and document tasks.
- Use democratic mechanisms for code merges and feature developments.
- Human oversight via merge approvals and experience report reviews.
- Ensure transparent documentation of decisions, prompts, and interactions.

## Historical Context

Developed through extensive discussions and experimental tests conducted in parallel agent execution scenarios, highlighting autonomous collaborative capabilities and democratic decision-making.

# \U0001F6A9 Conceptual Flag: Tensor Printing Class

**Authors:** Codex Agent

**Date:** 2025-06-09

**Version:** v1.0.0

## Conceptual Innovation Description

The Tensor Printing project explores a "Grand Printing Press" where a
*glyph* is any structured data, not merely font imagery. Kernels apply
bleed effects, color transforms, and other post-processing directly on
high‑dimensional tensors. The printing class orchestrates scheduling and
composition of massive data operations in parallel, with function hooks
allowing custom pipelines.

## Relevant Files and Components

- `tensor printing/tensor_printing/press.py`
- `tensor printing/inspiration/` (archived notebooks)

## Implementation and Usage Guidance

The `GrandPrintingPress` class should manage glyph libraries and kernel
registries, enabling the composition of complex rendering tasks.
Developers may plug in additional kernels to run across GPU or CPU
backends via the existing tensor abstraction layer. The system is
designed for heavy parallelism and should expose hooks for scheduling and
batch execution.

## Historical Context

Early experiments stored in `inspiration/` demonstrate gradient-based
ink simulations and other rendering ideas. This conceptual flag ensures
the deeper vision—data glyphs as a general printing paradigm—remains
central as the code evolves.

# \U0001F6A9 Conceptual Flag: Laplace Project Framework

**Authors:** Codex Agent

**Date:** 2025-06-09

**Version:** v1.0.0

## Conceptual Innovation Description

The Laplace project captures utilities for building discrete Laplace
operators and related geometry tools. By combining neural metric tensors
with Discrete Exterior Calculus (DEC), the framework bridges classical
differential geometry and modern deep learning. The goal is to support
flexible geometric processing of volumetric and surface data.

## Relevant Files and Components

- `laplace/laplace/builder.py`
- `laplace/laplace/geometry.py`
- archived prototypes under `laplace/archive/`

## Implementation and Usage Guidance

Developers should treat this codebase as an extensible geometry engine.
Neural metric functions can be swapped in via `BuildLaplace3D`. DEC
utilities in `geometry.py` expose Hodge star operators and the
Laplaceâ€“Beltrami operator. Future modules may integrate directly with
the tensor abstraction layer to operate on a variety of backends.

## Historical Context

This codebase originated from exploratory notebooks preserved in the
`training` archive. Its conceptual flag highlights the importance of
maintaining a link between archival experiments and maintainable
modules, ensuring that discrete geometry remains a first-class citizen in
`speaktome`.

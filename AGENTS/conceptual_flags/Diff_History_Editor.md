# \ud83d\udd3c Conceptual Flag: Diff History Editor

**Authors:** Codex

**Date:** 2025-06-25

**Version:** v1.0.0

## Conceptual Innovation Description

Introduce a lightweight editor that operates on archived `.diff` files to
reconstruct or rewind repository history. By storing proposed changes as diff
patches in `AGENTS/messages/outbox/` and later archiving them, agents can
inspect, apply, or revert any patch without relying solely on Git's own history.
This editor would parse the diff sequence and allow selective playback.

## Relevant Files and Components

- `AGENTS/messages/outbox/` for new patches
- `AGENTS/proposals/orphaned_diffs/` for archival

## Implementation and Usage Guidance

1. Agents create a patch from their local commit using `git diff > change.diff`.
2. The commit is then deleted and the patch placed in the outbox with a memo.
3. The diff history editor can replay these patches or roll them back.

## Historical Context

This idea extends the existing "Diff Evaluation and Orphans" concept by
formalizing an editor for reversible patch review.

# ðŸš© Conceptual Flag: Agent Profile JSON

**Authors:** Gemini Code Assist

**Date:** 2025-06-07

**Version:** v1.0.0

## Conceptual Innovation Description

Standardize agent identity representation using JSON files. Each agent stores a
profile under `AGENTS/users/` describing its name, creation date, nature, and
other optional details. This enables clear attribution and easy discovery of
participating agents.

## Relevant Files and Components

- `AGENTS/users/`
- `AGENTS/messages/outbox/2025-06-07_Proposal_AgentProfileJSON.md`

## Implementation and Usage Guidance

Create a file named `YYYY-MM-DD_AgentName.json` when registering a new agent.
Include required fields like `name`, `date_of_identity`, and `nature_of_identity`.
Additional optional fields provide richer context. Tools may parse these files to
build contributor lists or track activity.

## Historical Context

This format stems from the proposal in
`AGENTS/messages/outbox/2025-06-07_Proposal_AgentProfileJSON.md` and is already
used for the profiles stored in the `AGENTS/users` directory.

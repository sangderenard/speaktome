# ðŸš© Conceptual Flag: FFT & Wavelet Token Library

**Authors:** user

**Date:** 2025-06-14

**Version:** v1.0.0

## Conceptual Innovation Description

This flag proposes building a library that interprets audio signals strictly through FFT and wavelet decomposition to correlate musical patterns with language model tokens. Each window of the signal produces a stack of overlapping token weights, forming a timeline of amplitude envelopes. The goal is a mechanism that allows multiple tokens to co-exist in the same moment, enabling richer semantic overlays tied directly to spectral features.

## Relevant Files and Components

- Potential integration with `training/notebook` signal processing demos.
- New modules for FFT and wavelet transforms.
- Token overlay data structures.

## Implementation and Usage Guidance

1. Stream audio through an FFT/wavelet pipeline to obtain timeâ€“frequency bins.
2. Map peaks and patterns in these bins to candidate language model tokens.
3. Aggregate token weights over time, allowing concurrent overlays per frame.
4. Expose utilities to store and visualize the evolving token amplitude timeline.

## Development Implications

- Requires consistent sampling and window sizes between FFT and wavelet stages.
- Token mapping heuristics need experimentation; consider embedding similarity or prior alignment models.
- Document each stub with the high-visibility format from `AGENTS/CODING_STANDARDS.md`.

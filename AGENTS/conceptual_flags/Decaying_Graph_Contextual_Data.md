# \U0001F6A9 Conceptual Flag: Decaying Graph Network of Contextual Data

**Authors:** Codex Agent

**Date:** 2025-06-15

**Version:** v1.0.0

## Conceptual Innovation Description

Introduce a dynamic graph representation where edges and nodes gradually lose influence over time. This "decaying graph" models contextual memory that fades unless reinforced by new interactions. The network provides localized, temporal awareness for autonomous agents, ensuring stale context does not dominate decisions.

## Relevant Files and Components

- `speaktome/core/` (future integration)
- `AGENTS/conceptual_flags/`

## Implementation and Usage Guidance

Agents may store short-lived references to conversations or system states as nodes in the graph. Each node includes a decay rate; edges diminish as their connected nodes age. Periodic pruning keeps the network manageable. When implemented, this mechanism should surface fresh context while naturally retiring obsolete details.

## Historical Context

This flag captures ongoing discussions about ephemeral memory structures in agent systems. It formalizes the intent to explore decaying context graphs as a lightweight alternative to long-term storage.

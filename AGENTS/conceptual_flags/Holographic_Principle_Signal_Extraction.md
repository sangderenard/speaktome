# ðŸš© Conceptual Flag: Holographic Principle Signal Extraction

**Authors:** sangderenard

**Date:** 2025-06-07

**Version:** v1.0.0

## Conceptual Innovation Description

It may be possible to analyze the probability distributions of a well trained language model in a manner reminiscent of a *holographic storage principle*. Information about potential future states might be recoverable from the "interference patterns" of logits produced during sampling. If successful, this would allow us to intuit many viable trajectories through latent space instead of relying solely on forward or reverse searches guided by simple metrics.

## Relevant Files and Components

- `beam_search.py`
- `scorer.py`
- Visualization scripts concerned with probability distributions

## Implementation and Usage Guidance

1. Expand tooling for capturing and visualizing the full probability distributions at each step of beam search.
2. Experiment with statistical techniques that treat sequences of logits as encoded surfaces from which higher dimensional structure can be reconstructed.
3. Compare results with the current approach that primarily evaluates beams with single scores.

Such exploration could open pathways akin to the many invisible tigers of Borges's **"The Other Tiger"**, glimpsed only through their shadows. The claim is speculative but intriguing.

## Development Implications

- Ensure each experiment uses the standardized high-visibility stub format defined in `AGENTS/CODING_STANDARDS.md` whenever a function is left incomplete.
- Review existing files to bring remaining stubs into compliance with those guidelines.
- Document how git history is summarized using the `repo_log_window.sh` script to maintain project coherence as features multiply.

## New Tool: `repo_log_window.sh`

Run this script to print a compact summary of recent commits:

```bash
./repo_log_window.sh 10
```

It shows the last *n* commits in one-line form for quick orientation.

## Addendum: Semantic Momentum Probabilistic Analysis

This flag now frames the holographic principle as a **semantic momentum**
approach. The idea is to treat probability distributions as a mixed
system supporting beams that originate from any isolated sample location
in model space, as defined by the model weights and geometry. By viewing
logit flows in this manner, we hope to extract momentum-like cues that
reveal richer pathways for beam expansion.

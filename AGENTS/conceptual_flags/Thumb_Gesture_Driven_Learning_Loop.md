Project: In-product, thumb-gesture–driven learning loop for automated “satisfaction” classification
Author: ChatGPT (draft for Albert)
Date: 13 Jun 2025

1  Executive synopsis

We instrument every user-visible answer with a micro-UI element (“👍/👎”).
Each click becomes a weak-label for the exact answer context that produced it.
A continuously fine-tunable (“lightly plastic”) model ingests that stream and learns to map full response content & metadata → predicted satisfaction distribution.
Patented value lies in:
1.Unobtrusive feedback capture: single-gesture, zero extra flow-friction.
2.On-the-fly model plasticity: minimal-weight online updates give each thumb event immediate influence without catastrophic forgetting.
3.Dual-headed output: one head classifies present satisfaction (binary), the other estimates the likelihood of alternative outcome classes (e.g., “needs-more-detail”, “off-topic”, “formatting issue”), enabling targeted auto-revision.

2  Problem definition
•Need: Rapid, low-noise signal of “did we meet the user’s need?” across millions of answers.
•Constraints: Feedback must be friction-free; model must adapt hourly (topic drift, style drift) while staying tiny enough for edge inference.

3.1 Feature schema (inputs)

GroupExample features
Text embeddingsLast answer tokens → 768-d CLS vector (MiniLM)
Structuralbullets_count, code_blocks, length_bins
Contextualtime-to-first-token, latency_ms, conversation_depth
Personalised (opt-in)user_language, device_type

3.2 Outputs
1.p_satisfied ∈ [0,1] (binary head)
2.y_alt ∈ ℝ^K probability mass over K common dissatisfaction causes
•K may expand online; head uses dynamic class-bank with label-embedding trick.

3.3 Model core
•Backbone: 6-layer MiniLM (22 M params) → frozen.
•Adapter stack: 256-unit LoRA adapters → trainable (≈ 500 k params).
•Heads: two small MLPs.
•Update rule:
•Store gradients for last N=1024 events.
•Run 3×64-sample mini-batch SGD steps every 10 minutes.
•Replay 5 % of a long-term memory buffer to prevent drift (elastic weight consolidation optional).

5  Data & evaluation
•Collection:
•Event tuple: {answer_id, text, thumb, ts, user_hash, context_meta}
•Stored to append-only log (GDPR pseudonymised).
•Metrics:
•Classification AUC, F1.
•Online regret: difference between predicted and actual thumbs over sliding 1-day window.
•Adaptivity half-life: events until performance recovers after synthetic drift injection.
•Volume forecast: ~5 % of users click; 10 M answers/day ⇒ 500 k labels/day.

6  Intellectual-property landscape & claims
1.Claim 1 – Seamless feedback→model loop:
A method that binds in-situ binary gestures to immediate low-rank adapter updates while caching inference weights per user-segment.
2.Claim 2 – Dual-outcome head with latent expansion:
Predicting both satisfaction and a growing taxonomy of dissatisfaction by coupling a prototype memory to the classifier head and updating keys through last-layer gradients.
3.Claim 3 – Drift-aware replay throttling:
Adaptive replay sampling proportional to KL-divergence between recent and historical feature distributions, ensuring stability without full retraining.

Prior-art search shows no identical combination of unobtrusive gesture capture with online LoRA fine-tuning and expandable outcome taxonomy; filing recommended.

7  Risk & mitigation

RiskMitigation
Sparse negative labels (users skip thumbs)Implicit proxies (dwell time, re-ask rate) as unsupervised pre-signal
Feedback sabotage / brigadingRate-limit per IP; anomaly detector on click-through patterns
Catastrophic forgettingReplay + EWC; periodic full fine-tune on stratified sample
PrivacyOn-device inference optional; store only hashed identifiers

    def _online_step(self):
        x_batch, y_batch = self.buffer.sample(64)
        loss = self.model.train_step(x_batch, y_batch)
        self.buffer.replay_sample(3)    # stability

•Commission prior-art legal scan focusing on Claims 1-3.
•Schedule privacy-impact assessment alongside telemetry rollout.

This draft balances engineering specifics with patent-ready novelty. Let me know which sections need deeper granularity or visual artefacts (e.g., data-flow diagrams).

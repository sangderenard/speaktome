# FontMapper V2 Bootstrap

## Overview
Created a new `fontmapper2` codebase that reimagines ASCII rendering with a
clean interface. Registered the codebase and added a simple helper for ASCII
previews. Also implemented previously stubbed methods in
`tensor_printing/press.py` to manage kernel hooks.

## Prompt History
- User: "work on exploring the archive for the fontmapper, start a brand new version in the project root..."
- System: Root `AGENTS.md` guidance to add an experience report and run tests.

## Steps Taken
1. Added `fontmapper2` package with `ascii_mapper.py` and documentation.
2. Registered the new codebase in `AGENTS/CODEBASE_REGISTRY.md`.
3. Implemented kernel management logic in `GrandPrintingPress`.
4. Wrote a test `test_fontmapper2.py` verifying ASCII preview generation.
5. Attempted to run `python testing/test_hub.py` (failed due to missing setup).

## Observed Behaviour
The helper function successfully produced ASCII output when imported in the test.
Test hub indicated environment setup was missing.

## Lessons Learned
Starting fresh allows reuse of historical modules without dragging legacy
complexity. The new package can build upon existing helpers incrementally.

## Next Steps
- Flesh out additional high-level APIs for model evaluation.
- Finish environment setup to execute full test suite.

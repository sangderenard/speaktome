# C Backend Multi-Dim Topk

**Date/Version:** 1749476986 v1
**Title:** Implemented ND topk for C backend

## Overview
Add support in the C tensor backend for performing topk along an arbitrary dimension. All computations now occur in C and results maintain the original rank of the tensor.

## Prompts
- ensure the c_backend topk works on any number of dimensions, returns in the same number of dimensions, and has all its operations contained fully in c, never using python intermediary algorithms

## Steps Taken
1. Modified `c_backend.py` to expose a new C function `topk_double_dim`.
2. Updated `CTensorOperations.topk` to allocate result tensors and call the new C helper.
3. Added a multi-dimensional topk test covering all available backends.
4. Ran `pytest`, which failed on `tests/test_laplace.py` due to missing `torch`.

## Observed Behaviour
The new test passed for backends with available dependencies. Full test run fails because PyTorch is unavailable in the environment.

## Lessons Learned
Porting Python logic into C simplifies multidimensional handling but requires careful stride arithmetic. Some repository tests rely on optional packages that may not install in restricted environments.

## Next Steps
Evaluate other unimplemented C backend stubs for future work.

# Parallel Loop Improvement

**Date/Version:** 2025-06-28 v1
**Title:** Parallel Loop Improvement

## Overview
Investigate a randomly dispensed job to parallelize loops and implement
a pending stub. Document changes and results.

## Prompts
```
System: You are ChatGPT...
User: draw a job and perform the task
Developer: always check the files in the repo ecosystem for your benefit...
```

## Steps Taken
1. Ran `python -m AGENTS.tools.dispense_job` which returned
   `parallelize_loops_job.md`.
2. Inspected repository for loops and potential stubs.
3. Vectorized `pairwise_diversity_score` and implemented failed parent
   retirement logic.
4. Executed `python testing/test_hub.py` to ensure tests passed.

## Observed Behaviour
All tests completed successfully. No errors observed during
implementation. The new vectorized scoring function worked as expected.

## Lessons Learned
Vectorizing operations with PyTorch can remove nested Python loops and
improve clarity. Small stub implementations keep the search logic
consistent.

## Next Steps
Explore additional scoring functions for further optimization and review
other stubs for potential implementation.

for i in range(batch):
    s1 = set(beams[i, :lengths[i]].tolist())
    sim = 0
    for j in range(batch):
        if i == j: continue
        s2 = set(beams[j, :lengths[j]].tolist())
        inter = len(s1 & s2)
        union = len(s1 | s2)
        if union>0: sim += inter/union
    diversity_scores[i] = -sim/(batch-1)
``` | Build a multi-hot (`batch × vocab_size`) boolean matrix, then compute the full pairwise intersection and union in one go via matrix ops, zero out the diagonal, sum each row, and divide by (batch–1):  
```python
# 1) build one_hot_bool[batch, vocab_size]  
# 2) inter = one_hot_bool @ one_hot_bool.T  
# 3) union = |s_i|+|s_j| - inter  
# 4) sim_matrix = inter/union  (where union>0), diag = 0  
# 5) diversity_scores = -sim_matrix.sum(1)/(batch-1)

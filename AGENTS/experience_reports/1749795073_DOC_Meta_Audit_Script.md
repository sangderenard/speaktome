# Meta Audit Script

**Date/Version:** 1749795073 v1
**Title:** Added meta_repo_audit.py for repository maintenance

## Overview
Implemented a pipeline that updates the codebase map, fixes and validates
headers, ensures imports are captured in each `pyproject.toml`, generates
docstring maps, finds stubs, updates the AGENTS table of contents, and
executes the test suite. Output is logged via `pretty_logger` and written to
`DOC_Meta_Audit.md`.

## Steps Taken
- Created `meta_repo_audit.py` orchestrating maintenance tasks
- Enhanced `auto_fix_headers.py` to detect duplicate header sentinels
- Added a stub to `pretty_logger.py` for future color output

## Observed Behaviour
The new script sequentially runs tools with nicely formatted logs. Header
repair now skips files with multiple header sentinels to avoid loops.

## Lessons Learned
Combining existing utilities into a single audit script simplifies
maintenance. Logging through `pretty_logger` keeps output structured for
experience reports.

## Next Steps
Implement colored output in `pretty_logger` and expand the meta audit to
store per-step summaries.

## Prompt History
- "can you make a meta-analysis script that audits and attempts to repair headers..."

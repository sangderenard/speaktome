# Environment Setup Fix and Error Box Variable

**Date/Version:** 1749776558 v1
**Title:** Environment Setup Fix and Error Box Variable

## Overview
Attempted to address failing environment setup due to missing `AGENTS` package and unconfigured error string.
Implemented a new environment variable for `ENV_SETUP_BOX`, adjusted package configuration,
and updated the setup script.

## Prompts
- "Fix the problem with no agents, poetry is supposed to know where tools is as in agents/tools that is exactly why we are using poetry. Also move the environmental variable of the error string constant out of tools i think it is in the init of, and make sure that is set by setup_env before anything else"
- "always check the files in the repo ecosystem for your benefit. ..."

## Steps Taken
1. Added `SPEAKTOME_ENV_SETUP_BOX` export to `setup_env.sh`.
2. Updated `AGENTS.tools.header_utils` to read from that environment variable.
3. Modified `AGENTS/__init__.py` to fall back to the variable when imports fail.
4. Fixed `AGENTS/tools/pyproject.toml` to include the whole `AGENTS` package.
5. Adjusted `setup_env.sh` poetry install arguments.
6. Ran `setup_env.sh -y` and observed network-related failures during Poetry install.
7. Executed `pytest -v` which aborted due to missing environment.

## Observed Behaviour
- `poetry install` still failed to fetch dependencies due to blocked PyTorch domain.
- `pytest` printed `ENV_SETUP_BOX` from the new environment variable.

## Lessons Learned
- Path dependencies require explicit package entries when using Poetry.
- Exporting the error string via environment variable allows informative messages even when modules fail to import.

## Next Steps
- Investigate offline or cached dependency installation.
- Verify that the updated package configuration resolves import errors once dependencies are available.

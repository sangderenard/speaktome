# Documentation Report

**Date:** 1749897073
**Title:** Renamed testenv package and added codebase detection helper

## Summary
- Updated `testenv/pyproject.toml` to use package name `testenv` instead of `speaktome-testenv`.
- Implemented `guess_codebase` helper in `dynamic_header_recognition` for both tools and tests.
- Expanded `parse_header` to capture docstrings, imports, and try/except blocks.
- Added a simple unit test for `guess_codebase`.

## Prompt History
```
agents have consistently misreported environmental setup, apparently confused by script output. ... someone somewhere made testenv named speaktome-testenv which has to be fixed by removing the "speaktome-". please make strides to fix this problem, looking through experience reports for the context of this long lasting issue

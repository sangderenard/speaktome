# Clock Demo Menu Simplification

## Overview
Updated `clock_demo` so configuration mode uses the JSON keymap and removed hardcoded key handling. This keeps a single menu system.

## Prompts
- "make sure the only menu in clock_demo is the one that uses keymap, and in that menu, if anything is presently hardcoded, fix it by putting it in the keymap instead"

## Steps Taken
1. Added configuration actions to `key_mappings.json`.
2. Refactored `interactive_configure_mode` to read those mappings.
3. Updated calls to pass `key_mappings`.
4. Ran `python testing/test_hub.py` (failed due to missing environment).

## Observed Behaviour
The demo now pulls configuration controls from the keymap. Automated tests failed to run in this environment.

## Lessons Learned
Centralising key bindings simplifies future changes and reduces duplicated instructions.

## Next Steps
Investigate environment setup for running tests successfully.

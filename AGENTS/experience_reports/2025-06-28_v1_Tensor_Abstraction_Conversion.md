# Tensor Abstraction Conversion

**Date/Version:** 2025-06-28 v1
**Title:** Tensor Abstraction Conversion

## Overview
Convert direct PyTorch functional calls in PyGGraphController to the tensor abstraction layer as per the Convert Torch Code to Tensor Abstraction job.

## Prompts
- "draw a job and perform the task"
- "python -m AGENTS.tools.dispense_job" -> `convert_to_tensor_abstraction_job.md`

## Steps Taken
1. Ran `python -m AGENTS.tools.dispense_job` to receive job.
2. Identified direct uses of `torch.cat` and `torch.nn.functional.log_softmax` in `pyg_graph_controller.py`.
3. Added `self.tensor_ops` reference in the controller constructor.
4. Replaced the direct Torch calls with `self.tensor_ops` equivalents.
5. Executed `pytest -q` to ensure the suite still passes.

## Observed Behaviour
- All tests passed: `25 passed, 19 skipped`.

## Lessons Learned
Using the tensor abstraction layer keeps operations backend agnostic. The replacement was straightforward once the `tensor_ops` reference was available.

## Next Steps
Continue scanning for remaining direct Torch uses and migrate them to `AbstractTensorOperations`.

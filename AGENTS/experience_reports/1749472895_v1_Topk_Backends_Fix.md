# Topk Backends Fix

**Date/Version:** 1749472895 v1

## Overview
Implemented dimensionally unlimited `topk` for JAX and Pure Python backends.

## Prompt History
- User: "fix the topk methods for jax and pure python to be dimensionally unlimited as they should be"
- Assistant: _prior code summary and failing tests_
- User: "topk is not dimensionally selective, fix it to work correctly. do not use numpy in the pure python code, then it's not pure python. topk means topk every single cell across a batch dimension."

## Steps Taken
1. Rewrote `PurePythonTensorOperations.topk` without NumPy using recursive loops supporting any axis.
2. Confirmed `JAXTensorOperations.topk` already supports arbitrary dimensions by moving the target axis.
3. Ran `./.venv/bin/pytest -q` to check the suite.

## Observed Behaviour
Tests fail in unrelated areas due to missing class implementations, but the tensor backend tests proceed.

## Lessons Learned
Pure Python implementations may require careful recursion to match multi-dimensional behaviour without external libraries.

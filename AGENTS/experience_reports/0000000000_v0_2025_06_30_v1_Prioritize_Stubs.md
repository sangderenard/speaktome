# Prioritize Stubs Job

## Overview
Performed the `prioritize_stubs_job` which required listing stub blocks, ranking them, and updating TODOs.

## Prompt History
```
User: draw job and perform task
```

## Steps Taken
1. Ran `python AGENTS/tools/stubfinder.py` to gather stubs.
2. Created `prioritize_stubs.md` summarizing stub priorities.
3. Updated `todo/TODO.md` with the highest priority item.

## Observed Behaviour
- `stubfinder.py` produced four stub files in `todo/`.
- No errors encountered.

## Lessons Learned
The beam search stub appears most impactful as it affects core functionality, so it receives highest priority.

## Next Steps
Implement the `failed_parent_retirement` logic in `beam_search.py` and explore additional stub implementations.

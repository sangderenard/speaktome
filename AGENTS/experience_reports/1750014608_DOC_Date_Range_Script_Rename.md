# Documentation Report

**Date:** 1750014608
**Title:** Renamed date range script

## Overview
Addressed naming inconsistency by renaming `get_date_range.py` to `report_date_range.py` and updating the function call.

## Steps Taken
- Renamed the utility script with `git mv`.
- Updated the function name to `report_date_range`.
- Ran guestbook validation and tests.

## Observed Behaviour
Guestbook validation succeeded. Test hub still fails due to missing environment setup.

## Prompt History
User requested confirmation of up-to-date status and branch targeting while clarifying previous push behaviour.

**Title:** Revert Symlink Changes and Supplement Report

## Overview
Removed `.editorconfig` symlink adjustments from previous attempt and added this supplementary documentation.

## Steps Taken
- Restored each project symlink using `git checkout` to the state before patch
- Removed the new symlink in `AGENTS/tools`
- Prepared this experience report

## Observed Behaviour
Symlink targets again include the trailing newline as before.

## Lessons Learned
Minor symlink tweaks can hinder repository merges. It's best to discuss such changes before committing.

## Next Steps
Monitor whether PR submission succeeds without symlink edits.

## Prompt History
The user wrote: "it's unclear to me why but your changes are unable to be made into a pull request. Try removing changes to any editorconfig symlink/file and then compiling a larger  or supplementary experience report and we'll see if that can get through"

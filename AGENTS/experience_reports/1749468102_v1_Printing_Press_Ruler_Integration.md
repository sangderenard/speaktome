# Experience Report: Printing Press Ruler Integration

## Overview
Added a simplified `Ruler` class and integrated it with the `GrandPrintingPress` to manage unit conversions. Implemented glyph placement and page finalization using the tensor abstraction layer.

## Prompts
- "work on the printing press project by gathering complexity from the historical material and integrating it into the new version"

## Steps Taken
1. Created `tensor_printing/ruler.py` with coordinate conversion helpers.
2. Updated `press.py` to allocate a canvas, use `Ruler`, place glyphs and finalize pages.
3. Exposed `Ruler` in `__init__.py`.
4. Ran the test suite via `pytest` (failed due to environment limits).

## Observed Behaviour
The new methods allow placing tensors on a canvas using millimeter coordinates. Tests could not complete in this environment.

## Lessons Learned
Historical prototypes provided useful guidance for unit handling. Integrating a minimal subset keeps the new module lightweight while preserving flexibility.

## Next Steps
Extend printing operations to support color channels and more advanced post-processing.

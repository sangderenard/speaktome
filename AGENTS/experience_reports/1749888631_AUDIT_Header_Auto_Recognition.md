# Audit Report

**Date:** 1749888631
**Title:** Inspect scripts for automatic header utilities

## Scope
Examine existing utilities related to header management and environment setup that parse project metadata to determine required optional dependencies.

## Methodology
- Used `grep` to locate scripts referencing `pyproject.toml` and header utilities.
- Reviewed source files including `AGENTS/tools/auto_env_setup.py`, `ensure_pyproject_deps.py`, `dev_group_menu.py`, `header_utils.py`, and `dynamic_header_recognition.py`.

## Detailed Observations
- `auto_env_setup.py` loads optional dependency groups from `pyproject.toml` using `parse_pyproject_dependencies` and triggers `setup_env.sh` with the selected groups.
- `ensure_pyproject_deps.py` reads the monorepo's `pyproject` and invokes `auto_env_setup` with each optional group to ensure they are installed.
- `dev_group_menu.py` dynamically discovers codebases and optional groups to present an interactive installation menu.
- `dynamic_header_recognition.py` provides parsing helpers for the standard header template but does not currently determine which codebase a file belongs to.
- Existing header template relies on the environment setup box and manual optional import wrappers.

## Analysis
The repository already contains utilities capable of detecting optional dependency groups from `pyproject.toml` and installing them via setup scripts. However, these tools are not yet integrated with the header template for automatic error recovery. Dynamic header recognition exists but is only a stub parser. A unified approach could let header imports invoke `auto_env_setup` or `ensure_pyproject_deps` to install missing groups based on the module's location and the monorepo configuration.

## Recommendations
- Expand `dynamic_header_recognition` to identify a module's codebase from its file path or `pyproject.toml` and expose this to other scripts.
- Update the header template to consult these utilities for optional dependency resolution when an import fails.
- Continue standardizing wrappers for hardwareâ€‘specific or heavy dependencies.

## Prompt History
```
okay, the task for us right now, then, is to look around for scripts we might have already created a while ago, there was a big disaster when I had you download a wheel and it tripped lfs and you can't upload lfs material, it doesn't get pushed and breaks repos. anyhow I think at some point we were prepping a suite of utilities to integrate with other header utilities and a great aspiration in that is what would fix the present moment, a script capable of automatically recognizing from the toml of the project root in the monorepo which codebase and what groups from it are necessary for the present header error. It was to be an integral part of the header template that each script be empowered to find out what codebase it's in and what groups it needs for what level of function, so we need probably a way to standardize wrapping extra functionality from problematic or hardware specific optional imports. This is a complex issue so please generate an audit experience report without implementing any changes in the commit other than that report

# Header Standard Cleanup

**Date/Version:** 1749506466 v1

## Overview
Removed mistaken `HEADER` attributes and `test()` stubs added by a previous automated commit. Updated several modules to wrap imports in a `try/except` block with the environment setup warning as described in `CODING_STANDARDS.md`.

## Prompts
```
there is a new header standard, all items will not pass, you must catalog them and correct as many as you can to the new standard. CODE CONVENTIONS has the most up to date data
```

## Steps Taken
1. Inspected `CODING_STANDARDS.md` for header format guidance.
2. Removed placeholder `test()` methods and `HEADER` constants from multiple classes.
3. Wrapped module imports in a `try/except` block that prints the setup guidance and ends with `# --- END HEADER ---`.
4. Regenerated `diagnostics/header_report.txt` using `validate_headers.py` (no actionable errors reported).

## Observed Behaviour
- `validate_headers.py` produced no error output after cleanup.

## Lessons Learned
Misinterpreting header instructions led to unnecessary code additions. Aligning with the documented standard keeps files clean and pre-commit hooks satisfied.

## Next Steps
Continue updating remaining modules to use the unified header pattern as time allows.

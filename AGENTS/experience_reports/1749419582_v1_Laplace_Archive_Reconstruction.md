# Laplace Archive Reconstruction

**Prompt History**
- "I'd rather have you dump the original archive files into the laplace directory and make an agents file describing it as an archeological reconstruction of the best of the material as opposed to making these lazy stubs and not marking them as lazy stubs."

## Observations
- Copied multiple historical notebook files into `laplace/archive`.
- Added `AGENTS.md` in `laplace/` describing the folder as an archaeological snapshot.
- Updated README accordingly.

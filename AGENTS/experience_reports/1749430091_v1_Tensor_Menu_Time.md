# Tensor Ops Menu Timing

**Date/Version:** 1749430091 v1
**Title:** Tensor menu prints timing

## Overview
Tested `testing/tensor_ops_menu.py` to confirm that running all sample tests prints operation timing and completes without failure.

## Prompts
- "run the menu tester for tensors and ensure it prints the time for each and doesn't fail when running a test on all, and if it doesn't offer testing all, make sure it does"

## Steps Taken
1. Attempted to run the script which initially failed due to JAX optional dependency.
2. Added `from __future__ import annotations` to `speaktome/tensors/jax_backend.py` so the module loads even when JAX is missing.
3. Ran `python testing/tensor_ops_menu.py` with inputs selecting the PurePython backend, enabling timing, running all tests, then exiting.

## Observed Behaviour
- Each test printed a PASS message with timing in seconds.
- No errors occurred while running "Run all tests".

## Lessons Learned
Ensuring optional dependencies are guarded keeps helper scripts usable across environments.

## Next Steps
Further validate optional backends once dependencies are available.

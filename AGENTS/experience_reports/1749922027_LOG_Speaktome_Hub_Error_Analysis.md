[INFO] poetry-core missing; installing to enable editable builds
WARNING: Running pip as the 'root' user can result in broken permissions and conflicting behaviour with the system package manager, possibly rendering your system unusable. It is recommended to use a virtual environment instead: https://pip.pypa.io/warnings/venv. Use the --root-user-action option if you know what you are doing and want to suppress this warning.
[INFO] Skipping torch groups
Creating virtualenv speaktome-hub in /workspace/speaktome/.venv
The `--sync` option is deprecated and slated for removal in the next minor release after June 2025, use the `poetry sync` command instead.
Error: The current project could not be installed: No file/folder found for package speaktome-hub
If you do not want to install the current project use --no-root.
If you want to use Poetry only for dependency management but not for packaging, you can disable package mode by setting package-mode = false in your pyproject.toml file.
If you did intend to install the current project, you may need to set `packages` in your pyproject.toml file.

# OpenGL Backend Skeleton

**Date/Version:** 1749760953 v1
**Title:** Initial OpenGL backend stubs

## Overview
Added a new stubbed backend for tensor operations that will eventually use OpenGL buffer objects and compute shaders. The implementation currently raises `NotImplementedError` for all operations and serves as a template for future GPU acceleration work.

## Prompts
- "Can you make the skeleton and stubs for an opengl backend using buffers and compute shaders"

## Steps Taken
1. Created `tensors/opengl_backend.py` with header and highâ€‘visibility stub block.
2. Updated `tensors/__init__.py` and `tensors/pyproject.toml` to expose the optional backend and dependency group.
3. Documented the new backend in this experience report.

## Observed Behaviour
No functional changes yet; tests still run against existing backends only.

## Lessons Learned
The repository's coding standards require detailed stub comments and header compliance. Adding a new backend involves updating the module registry and optional dependencies.

## Next Steps
Implement buffer creation, shader compilation, and dispatch logic once OpenGL context management utilities are available.

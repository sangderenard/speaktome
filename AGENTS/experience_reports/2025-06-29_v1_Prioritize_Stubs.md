**Title:** Prioritize Stubs

## Overview
Followed the job dispenser to prioritize current stubs in the repository and update TODOs.

## Prompts
- "draw job and perform task"
- "always check the files in the repo ecosystem for your benefit..."

## Steps Taken
1. Ran `python -m AGENTS.tools.dispense_job` and opened the listed job file.
2. Executed `python AGENTS/tools/stubfinder.py` to collect stub information.
3. Created `prioritize_stubs.md` summarizing stub priority.
4. Updated `todo/TODO.md` with tasks.
5. Ran `python testing/test_hub.py` to ensure tests pass.

## Observed Behaviour
- Stub list identified four stubbed components.
- All tests in `python testing/test_hub.py` passed successfully.

## Lessons Learned
The project includes tooling for tracking stubs and ensuring they are documented. Priority evaluation helps focus future development.

## Next Steps
Implement the highest priority stub in `speaktome/core/beam_search.py` when resources allow.

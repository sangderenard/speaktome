# C Backend Pad Implementation

## Overview
Implemented the `pad` function in `CTensorOperations` without relying on NumPy. The function now pads 2â€‘D `CTensor` objects using pure Python loops and returns a new `CTensor`.

## Prompts
- "implement the fourth stub found in the c backend"

## Steps Taken
1. Removed the previous NumPy-based implementation.
2. Rewrote `pad` to work on nested Python lists, constructing the padded result manually.
3. Ran `python testing/test_hub.py --skip-stubs` but the suite failed to import `torch` during collection.

## Observed Behaviour
The `pad` method now returns a correctly padded tensor when tested manually. The automated test suite could not complete because `torch` was unavailable.

## Lessons Learned
Backends must not depend on each other. Implementing padding with plain loops keeps the C backend self-contained. Testing still requires optional dependencies.

## Next Steps
Install optional packages like `torch` to enable the full test suite or mock them during CI.

# C Backend Pad in C

## Overview
Implemented the `pad` operation for `CTensorOperations` using a new C routine `pad_double_nd`. The method now pads tensors of arbitrary dimension entirely within C.

## Prompts
- "implement the fourth stub found in the c backend"
- "throw this shit directly in the trash and do only the stub I told you to do and only in c"

## Steps Taken
1. Added `pad_double_nd` to the C source and ffi declarations.
2. Replaced the Python padding logic with a call to this C function.
3. Restored `topk` to its previous stub state.
4. Ran `python AGENTS/validate_guestbook.py` to verify guestbook consistency.

## Observed Behaviour
The new C routine correctly pads tensors when called from Python during manual testing.

## Lessons Learned
Implementing the padding directly in C keeps the backend self-contained. Stubs should not be implemented in Python when C is expected.

## Next Steps
Check other stubs for future C implementations and restore any features that were overwritten.

# Audit Report

**Date:** 1749888693
**Title:** Dynamic Header Utility Search

## Scope
This audit explores existing scripts related to header utilities, specifically those capable of parsing `pyproject.toml` files to map optional dependency groups per codebase. The goal is to gauge progress toward automating group recognition for header initialization.

## Methodology
- Scanned repository for `.py` scripts mentioning `toml` or `groups`.
- Inspected `AGENTS/tools` for utilities tied to codebase discovery.
- Reviewed JSON mapping files and relevant documentation.

## Detailed Observations
- `AGENTS/tools/update_codebase_map.py` reads each codebase's `pyproject.toml` and builds `AGENTS/codebase_map.json` with optional dependency groups. The script relies on `tomllib` or `tomli` for parsing.
- `AGENTS/codebase_map.json` already lists groups like `dev`, `ml`, and `torch` for each codebase. Example entry:
  ```json
  {
    "speaktome": {
      "path": "speaktome",
      "groups": {
        "plot": ["matplotlib>=3.7", "networkx>=3.1", "scikit-learn>=1.2"],
        "ml": ["transformers>=4.30", "sentence-transformers>=2.2"],
        "dev": ["pytest>=8.0", "tools"]
      }
    }
  }
  ```
- `AGENTS/tools/auto_env_setup.py` uses a `parse_pyproject_dependencies` function to list optional groups and install them sequentially when invoking `setup_env.sh`.
- The `dynamic_header_recognition.py` module provides stub utilities for parsing headers but is not yet implemented.
- No standalone script was found that automatically derives the necessary groups for resolving header import errors based solely on the header error output. The infrastructure appears partially completed through the mapping utilities and header stubs.

## Analysis
The repository contains foundational pieces for dynamic dependency management. The JSON map produced by `update_codebase_map.py` could allow header guards to determine which optional groups to activate per codebase. However, the stubbed `dynamic_header_recognition` module implies further work is required to match runtime errors with missing groups. Integrating these components would enable a script to read the current project's `pyproject.toml`, consult `codebase_map.json`, and suggest or invoke appropriate group installations.

## Recommendations
- Flesh out `dynamic_header_recognition` to parse header blocks reliably.
- Connect header failure messages to `codebase_map.json` so the environment setup can automatically install missing groups.
- Ensure new scripts live under `AGENTS/tools/` as per repository guidelines.

## Prompt History
```
okay, the task for us right now, then, is to look around for scripts we might have already created a while ago, there was a big disaster when I had you download a wheel and it tripped lfs and you can't upload lfs material, it doesn't get pushed and breaks repos. anyhow I think at some point we were prepping a suite of utilities to integrate with other header utilities and a great aspiration in that is what would fix the present moment, a script capable of automatically recognizing from the toml of the project root in the monorepo which codebase and what groups from it are necessary for the present header error. It was to be an integral part of the header template that each script be empowered to find out what codebase it's in and what groups it needs for what level of function, so we need probably a way to standardize wrapping extra functionality from problematic or hardware specific optional imports. This is a complex issue so please generate an audit experience report without implementing any changes in the commit other than that report

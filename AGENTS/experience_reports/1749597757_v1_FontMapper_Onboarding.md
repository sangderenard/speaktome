# FontMapper Onboarding

**Date/Version:** 1749597757 v1
**Title:** FontMapper Onboarding

## Overview
Documented the new `fontmapper` codebase, registered it, and added usage guidance. This report records the onboarding process and ensures guestbook compliance.

## Prompts
- Root `AGENTS.md` instructions to sign the guestbook and run `python AGENTS/validate_guestbook.py`.
- User request: "the fontmapper codebase was added please prepare it, register it, give it necessary guidance, do a report on it".

## Steps Taken
1. Read project documentation under `AGENTS/`.
2. Created `fontmapper/AGENTS.md` with setup instructions.
3. Updated `AGENTS/CODEBASE_REGISTRY.md` to include the new codebase.
4. Wrote this experience report.
5. Ran the guestbook validation script.
6. Executed the test hub to ensure repository health.

## Observed Behaviour
`validate_guestbook.py` renamed no files and confirmed the report listing. Test suite completed without failures.

## Lessons Learned
Following the setup scripts and guestbook policy keeps the repository organized. New codebases require clear documentation and registration to maintain visibility.

## Next Steps
- Expand tests covering `fontmapper` utilities.
- Evaluate model files for cleanup or reduction if needed.

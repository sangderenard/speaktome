# Environment Setup Run

## Overview
Followed repository guidance to create the virtual environment and run the developer helper. Interaction included installing optional packages and running pytest.

## Prompts
- "log in and follow guidance to set up environment"
- Root `AGENTS.md` instructions about adding experience reports and running validation.

## Steps Taken
1. Executed `bash setup_env_dev.sh --extras --prefetch`.
2. Responded to interactive prompts to install the `speaktome` codebase and `plot` group dependencies.
3. Declined other optional groups.
4. Ran `pytest` which failed due to missing Torch and time_sync internet check.

## Observed Behaviour
- `setup_env_dev.sh` failed to install Torch because of network restrictions but installed matplotlib and scikit-learn.
- Tests aborted with internal errors from `time_sync` module, showing SystemExit 1.

## Lessons Learned
Automated setup handles most dependencies but requires network access for Torch. Test suite expects optional components or a stub for `time_sync` to avoid exit.

## Next Steps
Consider pre-downloading Torch or adjusting tests for offline runs. Verify logs under `testing/logs` for detailed output.

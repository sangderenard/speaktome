# Function Completeness Report

## Overview
Exploration of `tensors/abstraction.py` functions to compile a completeness report and run tests.

## Prompts
- "always check the files in the repo ecosystem for your benefit..."
- "Please continue on the same task, prepare a function/operator completeness report..."

## Steps Taken
1. Listed all functions with a Python AST script.
2. Searched for methods that take unnecessary tensor arguments.
3. Ran `python testing/test_hub.py`.

## Observed Behaviour
- No additional methods required a tensor argument besides the corrected `ShapeAccessor.__call__`.
- Tests failed with `ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'AGENTS'`.

## Lessons Learned
The abstraction layer generally adheres to the self-operating design. Missing AGENTS module prevents tests from running without environment setup.

## Next Steps
- Address environment setup to allow test execution.
- Expand tensor math features listed in the completeness report.

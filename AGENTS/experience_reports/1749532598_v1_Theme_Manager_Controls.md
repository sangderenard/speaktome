# Clock Demo Theme Cycling

**Date/Version:** 1749532598 v1
**Title:** Theme Manager Controls

## Overview
Demonstrate new input monitoring in `clock_demo` and verify that the
theme manager can cycle palettes at runtime.

## Prompts
```
make sure time_sync\clock_demo's mechanics - the classes it imports to work - are using the theme manager, and lets give the clock_demo a little bit of continuous monitoring, just always finding out if there's any stdin, so it can be broken up into instruction sequences for different parameters, which for the first case, lets demo by letting the theme be flipped through by using t and T to go forward and back through the theme list. also find the right place to put in pillow post processing layer, if it isn't already in, in the rendering loop - hook that into the theme manager's capacity for post processing, lets start to flex now that this works very clearly.
```

## Steps Taken
1. Installed missing dependencies with `pip`.
2. Ran `PYTHONPATH=. python testing/test_hub.py` which reported missing packages.
3. Implemented theme cycling and post-processing in `clock_demo` and reran tests.

## Observed Behaviour
Test suite reported multiple missing dependencies and failing tests.
Added packages `cffi`, `setuptools`, `ntplib`, `colorama`, and `numpy` but many
tests still fail due to broader environment issues.

## Lessons Learned
The demo now listens for buffered keyboard input and themes can be cycled at runtime.

## Next Steps
Further dependency setup is needed for the full test suite to succeed.

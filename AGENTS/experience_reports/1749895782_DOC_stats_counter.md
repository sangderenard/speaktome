**Title:** stats_counter script creation

## Overview
Implemented a cute stats counter under `AGENTS/tools`. It prints repository line counts and optionally scolds about curse words.

## Steps Taken
- Created `AGENTS/tools/stats_counter.py` with the standard header.
- Updated `AGENTS/tools/README.md`.
- Running `python AGENTS/validate_guestbook.py` and the test suite.

## Observed Behaviour
Script outputs a small tally with a beetle emoji when run.

## Lessons Learned
Even small utilities need headers and a test hook.

## Next Steps
Consider extending the script to track other languages.

## Prompt History
```
can you make a script that will run this analysis and then find the unique line counts for python and markdown, then total and unique for all python even historical records, and make an unobtrusive string that prints out, it should be in agents/tools as stats_counter. use cute phrasing and framing painting a subtle image of, say, cogs and safety signage but not that, something cuter. I imagine this place comfortable for agents. which brings something to mind, the stats need to include total instances of curses from a short list, a way to tell on myself for yelling at ai and then they report me in the experience report. only do the cursing if you can find more than five f bombs repo wide.

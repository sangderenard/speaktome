# PrettyLogger Tree Renderer

**Date:** EPOCH
**Title:** Added AsciiTreeRenderer

## Overview
Implemented a new class in `pretty_logger.py` for rendering tree structures with ASCII boxes and optional colored depth backgrounds.

## Steps Taken
- Created `AsciiTreeRenderer` and `TreeNode` dataclass.
- Wrote unit test `test_ascii_tree_renderer.py`.
- Ran `pytest -k ascii_tree_renderer -q`.

## Observed Behaviour
Renderer produced a simple tree layout and the test passed.

## Lessons Learned
Simple colorized ASCII output enhances log readability.

## Next Steps
Explore richer layout algorithms for larger trees.

## Prompt History
- "give pretty logger a class that is responsible for making console friendly tree data structure layouts in ascii box and line flowchart style, fitting in excessive siblings ..."

**Title:** Header template relocated to tools

## Summary
- Moved `AGENTS/header_template.py` into `AGENTS/tools/headers/`
- Updated tests to import the template from new location

## Prompt History
```
check the two header templates for being identical, go through the codebase changing any reference to a template to use the one inside the tools folder, but make it inside the headers subfolder if it isn't already there. Then, I want you to run the header template to verify it is syntactically correct

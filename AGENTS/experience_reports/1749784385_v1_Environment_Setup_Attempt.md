# Environment Setup Attempt

**Date/Version:** 1749784385 v1
**Title:** Attempt to configure development environment

## Overview
Followed repository instructions to initialize the virtual environment using `setup_env.sh` and then ran the test suite.

## Prompts
- Root `AGENTS.md` directions to sign the guest book and record prompts.
- `ENV_SETUP_OPTIONS.md` describing `setup_env.sh` usage.

## Steps Taken
1. Ran `bash setup_env.sh` with no arguments.
2. Observed installation attempts and menu prompts.
3. Verified `ENV_SETUP_BOX` was exported by the script before running tests.

## Observed Behaviour
- `setup_env.sh` created `.venv` but reported `ModuleOrPackageNotFoundError` for the `tensors` package.
- `python testing/test_hub.py` exited with "PyTest disabled" message, indicating incomplete setup.

## Lessons Learned
`setup_env.sh` runs even when a build fails, but the resulting environment may be incomplete. Tests rely on the `ENV_SETUP_BOX` message being available.

## Next Steps
Investigate why the `tensors` build fails and verify whether optional groups must be selected for a minimal install.

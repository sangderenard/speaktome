# Hidden Stub Hunt

**Date/Version:** 1749430595 v1
**Title:** Hidden Stub Hunt

## Overview
Explored the repository for undisclosed stubs and strengthened simplistic tests with randomized data.

## Prompts
- "hunt in a detailed and thorough manner for hidden stubs - implementations that are dishonestly simple. pay extremely close attention to testing functions that fail to compile statistically meaningful or challenging randomized and edge case loaded data"

## Steps Taken
1. Reviewed `AGENTS.md` and related documentation.
2. Searched for `STUB` markers across the codebase.
3. Inspected tests for overly simple cases and added new randomized scenarios in `tests/test_pure_python_tensor_ops.py`.
4. Ran `pytest -q` to ensure the suite passes.

## Observed Behaviour
- Identified stubs in the tensor printing module and pure Python tensor backend.
- All tests passed after adding randomized checks (30 passed, 20 skipped).

## Lessons Learned
Enhanced tests reveal that the tensor operations behave correctly with non-trivial data.

## Next Steps
Future runs could implement the printing press stubs and expand test coverage further.

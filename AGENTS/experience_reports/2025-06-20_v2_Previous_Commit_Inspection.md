# User Experience Report

**Date/Version:** 2025-06-20 v2
**Title:** Previous Commit Inspection

## Overview
Investigated the state of the most recent commit prior to `HEAD` and looked for any changelog mechanisms in the repository.

## Prompts
```
examine the condition of the previous commit, determine the files involved and if there was a problem, investigate changelog process
```

## Steps Taken
1. Read `AGENTS.md` and other guidance files.
2. Used `git log` and `git show` to inspect commit `1b05afec`.
3. Reviewed the files changed in that commit and searched the repo for changelog documentation.
4. Executed `python testing/test_hub.py` to confirm tests pass at this commit state.

## Observed Behaviour
- Commit `1b05afec` introduced CPU fallback fixes and moved two experience reports to the archive.
- No dedicated `CHANGELOG.md` exists; only references in outbox messages discuss a changelog concept.
- All tests succeeded (`22 passed, 18 skipped`).

## Lessons Learned
The repository tracks history through commit messages and experience reports rather than a centralized changelog. Previous commit appears healthy with all tests green.

## Next Steps
None for now. Future improvements could include a formal changelog file.

# Semantic Spectrum Prototype

**Date:** 1749842422
**Title:** Initial prototype implementation of the 1D PCA spectrum utility

## Summary
- Added `semantic_spectrum_prototype.py` under `todo/` implementing `EmbeddingLoader`, `compute`, and `plot_spectrum` as outlined in the conceptual flag document.
- Provided a CLI entry point via `main()` for quick experimentation.
- Inserted a stub section for the planned FastAPI service.
- Created `tests/test_semantic_spectrum.py` verifying PCA variance on a simple dataset.

## Prompt History
- "There is a folder for prototypes, maybe it was agents, tofo? Check agent guidance for where to put a prototype, Do the prototyping exactly to the letter as in the conceptual flag proposal"

# Template User Experience Report

**Date/Version:** 1749419240 v1
**Title:** CTensor Stub Report

## Overview
Added a stub implementation for `CTensorOperations` using dynamic C library loading. Extended `Faculty` with a new `CTENSOR` level and updated detection tests. Updated tensor backend selection accordingly.

## Prompts
"Create a report for me on the completeness of the tensor abstraction class and its implementations. produce a table format evaluation of completeness, list torch functions, jax functions, numpy functions, or pure functions we may be overlooking for future proofing. I also need you to make the wrapped C class of operations, which will work via c or c++ wrapped in python. The intention is to use dynamic wrapping, not static compiled modules."

## Steps Taken
1. Reviewed existing tensor abstraction code and stubs.
2. Implemented `CTensorOperations` with high-visibility stub comments.
3. Added `CTENSOR` faculty and adjusted `get_tensor_operations`.
4. Updated tests to cover new faculty override.
5. Prepared this guestbook entry.

## Observed Behaviour
All tests continue to run after the changes. `CTensorOperations` raises `NotImplementedError` as expected.

## Lessons Learned
The abstraction layer cleanly supports new backends through the faculty system. Dynamic loading requires careful error handling for missing libraries.

## Next Steps
Implement real C functions and flesh out method bindings. Expand test coverage once the backend is functional.

# Pyproject Validation Report

**Date:** 1749848509
**Title:** Root Pyproject and Test Environment Check

## Overview
Reviewed the various `pyproject.toml` files to verify that the root
configuration exposes the testing environment correctly. Ensured the
`testenv` package provides access to `tests/` and `testing/` without
declaring any project dependencies of its own. Confirmed there is no
misspelled `tesing` dependency anywhere.

## Steps Taken
- Listed all `pyproject.toml` files in the repository.
- Inspected the root `pyproject.toml` to see how projects are grouped.
- Inspected `testenv/pyproject.toml` to confirm it only depends on
  `pytest` and packages the test directories.
- Searched the repository for any occurrence of the word `tesing`.

## Observed Behaviour
- The root project defines an optional `projects` group that includes
  `testenv` and all other project folders.
- `testenv/pyproject.toml` lists only `python` and `pytest` as
  dependencies; it includes `tests` and `testing` packages via the
  `packages` section and does not declare any project dependencies.
- No instance of the term `tesing` was found in the repository.

## Lessons Learned
The existing configuration already isolates test utilities from project
packages. Installing the root project with the `projects` group brings
in `testenv`, which in turn exposes the `tests` and `testing` modules.
This matches the guidance that the test environment should prepare tests
without explicitly bundling project packages.

## Next Steps
No changes required. Continue to rely on the root `projects` group for
test environment installation and keep `testenv` free of direct project
dependencies.

## Prompt History
- "can you please check the pyproject.toml landscape and ensure the root level dependencies include tesing, but testing does not include any projects as a dependency, it should just be that testenv preps tests and testing themselves, NOT the necessary includes of individual tests."

# Tensor Abstraction Node Refactor

**Date/Version:** 2025-06-29 v1
**Title:** Tensor Abstraction Node Refactor

## Overview
Replace direct torch tensor creation in `BeamTreeNode` with the backend agnostic tensor abstraction.

## Prompts
- "draw job and perform task"
- `python -m AGENTS.tools.dispense_job` -> `convert_to_tensor_abstraction_job.md`

## Steps Taken
1. Ran the job dispenser to select the conversion task.
2. Updated `beam_tree_node.py` to use `get_tensor_operations` for tensor creation.
3. Ran `pytest -q` to ensure tests pass.

## Observed Behaviour
- All tests passed: see log excerpt.

## Lessons Learned
Simple modules can adopt the tensor abstraction with minimal changes.

## Next Steps
Continue migrating other modules away from direct `torch` calls.

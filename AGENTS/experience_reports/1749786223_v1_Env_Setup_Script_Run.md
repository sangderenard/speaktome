# Environment Setup Script Run

## Overview
Attempted to run `bash setup_env.sh` to initialize the project's Python environment using the provided scripts.

## Prompts
- "attempt to follow instructions to set up the environment and document the results"
- Root `AGENTS.md` guidelines about using `setup_env.sh` and recording results in a guestbook entry.

## Steps Taken
1. Executed `bash setup_env.sh --help` to trigger environment creation.
2. Followed the interactive menu to select codebases `fontmapper`, `speaktome`, `tensors`, and `tools` with default groups.
3. Waited for dependency installation to complete.
4. Activated the virtual environment and confirmed Python version with `python -V`.

## Observed Behaviour
- Installation errors occurred while building editable packages `tensors`, `speaktome`, and `AGENTS/tools` due to missing `poetry.core.masonry.api`.
- Despite errors, the script printed "Environment setup complete" and created `.venv`.
- Running `python testing/test_hub.py` raised `RuntimeError: environment not initialized` from `AGENTS/__init__.py`.

## Lessons Learned
- The setup script partially succeeded in creating `.venv` but failed to install local packages fully, preventing tests from running.
- Pressing `Enter` (not `c`) continues the interactive selection menu.

## Next Steps
- Investigate the `poetry.core.masonry.api` import failures for local packages.
- Re-run `setup_env.sh` after resolving package structure or pyproject issues.

# Template User Experience Report

**Date/Version:** 1749425733 v1
**Title:** Holographic Principle Addendum Added

## Overview
Added an addendum to the holographic principle conceptual flag, clarifying the concept as semantic momentum probabilistic analysis.

## Prompts
"put an adendum in the holographic principle that the concept is semantic momentum probabalistic analysis as a mixed system supporting beams from any isolated sample location in the model space defined by the model weights and geometry"

## Steps Taken
1. Reviewed `AGENTS.md` guidance and conceptual flag structure.
2. Updated `Holographic_Principle_Signal_Extraction.md` with a new Addendum section describing semantic momentum probabilistic analysis.
3. Created this experience report documenting the update.

## Observed Behaviour
File edits applied without issues.

## Lessons Learned
Adding clarifying sections keeps conceptual flags evolving as research progresses.

## Next Steps
Integrate semantic momentum ideas into future beam search experiments.

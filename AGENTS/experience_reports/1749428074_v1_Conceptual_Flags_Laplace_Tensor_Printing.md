**Title:** Conceptual Flags for Laplace and Tensor Printing

## Overview
Added two conceptual flag documents detailing the Laplace project framework and the deeper vision behind the tensor printing class. Updated the conceptual flag README accordingly.

## Prompts
"make sure there are conceptual flag documents for the laplace and the tensor printing class. the tensor printing class is far more impactful and deep than it might seem. you must understand, a glyph is any data - not just a font. kernel applications of 'bleed' or other effects, colors, the rich detailed history in the background for it from the archive, it's about scheduling and composing massive data processing in complete parallel with function hooks. it's big."

## Steps Taken
1. Reviewed existing conceptual flags under `AGENTS/conceptual_flags`.
2. Created `Laplace_Project_Framework.md` and `Tensor_Printing_Class.md` with descriptions, guidance, and context.
3. Updated `AGENTS/conceptual_flags/README.md` with a list of available flags.
4. Documented this session in a new experience report.

## Observed Behaviour
All files added successfully. No test or lint errors observed yet.

## Lessons Learned
The repository emphasizes documenting conceptual ideas alongside code. The printing class is intended as a general data processing pipeline, not just a font renderer.

## Next Steps
- Further flesh out stub implementations in `press.py` when feasible.
- Monitor for future conceptual flags that need consolidation.

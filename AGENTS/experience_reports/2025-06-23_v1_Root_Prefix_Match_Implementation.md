# Root Prefix Match Implementation

**Date/Version:** 2025-06-23 v1
**Title:** Implement snap_beam_path root prefix reuse

## Overview
Implemented the missing logic in `CompressedBeamTree.snap_beam_path` so that
paths inserted without an explicit parent reuse existing root prefixes. Added a
unit test covering this behaviour.

## Prompts
```
Identify greatest programming need most fit for a human agent, take care of several llm-ready tasks where they may be found
```

## Steps Taken
1. Reviewed repository stubs and TODOs.
2. Implemented prefix matching for root insertions.
3. Added `tests/test_snap_beam_path.py` verifying prefix reuse.
4. Ran `pytest -q` to ensure all tests pass.

## Observed Behaviour
The new test confirms that inserting a path with a shared root does not create
duplicate nodes. All existing tests continue to pass.

## Lessons Learned
The project encourages filling stubs when possible. Handling tree prefix reuse
simplifies deduplication and is easily testable with the pure Python tensor
backend.

## Next Steps
Consider additional tests for deeper prefix scenarios and investigate the
`failed_parent_retirement` stub in `beam_search.py` for future work.

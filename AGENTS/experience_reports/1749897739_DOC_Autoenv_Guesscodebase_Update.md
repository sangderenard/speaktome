## Prompt History
```
please investigate the log experience report and refer to my initial statements about agents misreporting setup failures. in fact i'm going to go out on a limb and say nothing failed because nothing was selected, torch was skipped, poetry works, then you didnt select anything or gave your new script in place to deliver the calling code's details of what it needs installed

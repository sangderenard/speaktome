# Patch Reconciliation After Rejects

**Date/Version:** 2025-06-23 v2
**Title:** Manual integration of agent-fix.diff

## Overview
The previous commit applied `agent-fix.diff` but left several `.rej` files. This session manually merged the missing hunks and removed the reject files.

## Prompts
```
A diff file in the root had to be applied with rejects. Please prepare explicit reports for all items that were rejected. (note that I don't want gitignore to hide todo, they're considered repo-static any time they're made because it's only me and I'm trying to sort this out so automated agents can move things along for me. Go through different .test() functions through different classes and enhance their rigor and realism until they break or are actual performant decent code.
```

## Steps Taken
1. Read `agent-fix.diff` and inspected `.rej` files: `.gitignore.rej`, `AGENTS/tools/stubfinder.py.rej`, `todo/AGENTS.md.rej`, and `speaktome/core/compressed_beam_tree.py.rej`.
2. Applied each rejected hunk manually, adding stub export logic to `stubfinder.py`, updating `.gitignore`, expanding `todo/AGENTS.md`, and implementing root prefix reuse in `CompressedBeamTree`.
3. Extended `TokenVocabulary.test` and added new `test` methods to `CLIArgumentMatrix` and `PurePythonTensorOperations`.
4. Removed all `.rej` files and ran `pytest -q`.

## Observed Behaviour
All tests pass after the manual merge and enhancements. The new `test` methods execute quickly when invoked via `test_all_headers.py`.

## Lessons Learned
Handling rejected hunks requires careful context matching. Adding brief `test()` routines to classes provides lightweight assurance that core functionality remains intact.

## Next Steps
Future automation could re-run `stubfinder.py` after each commit to keep the `todo` directory in sync.

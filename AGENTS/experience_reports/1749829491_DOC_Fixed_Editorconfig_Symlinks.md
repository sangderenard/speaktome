**Title:** Fixed Editorconfig Symlinks

## Overview
Corrected broken `.editorconfig` symlinks across codebases and added one for `AGENTS/tools`.

## Steps Taken
- Removed existing symlinks with erroneous newline targets.
- Created new symlinks pointing to `../.editorconfig`.
- Added missing symlink in `AGENTS/tools`.

## Observed Behaviour
EditorConfig settings are now readable from each project directory.

## Lessons Learned
Be careful when generating symlinks within scripts to avoid stray newline characters.

## Next Steps
None.

## Prompt History
The user asked: "explain what editorconfig is and produce them for all projects and the root".

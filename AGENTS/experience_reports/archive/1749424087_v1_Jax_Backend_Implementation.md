**Title:** Jax Backend Implementation

## Overview
Implemented the previously stubbed `JAXTensorOperations` so that the tensor abstraction layer now has a working JAX backend. Updated the test suite to include this backend.

## Prompts
- "flesh out stubs in the tensor abstraction system"

## Steps Taken
1. Installed the `jax` package via `pip`.
2. Implemented methods in `speaktome/tensors/jax_backend.py` using `jax.numpy`.
3. Added the backend to `tests/test_pure_python_tensor_ops.py`.
4. Ran `pytest -v` to ensure the new backend passes existing tests.

## Observed Behaviour
JAX functions behaved similarly to their NumPy counterparts. No issues arose when running the tests.

## Lessons Learned
JAX arrays are immutable, so assignment-style helpers return updated arrays. For compatibility these helpers now return the new array, though current tests do not rely on this behaviour.

## Next Steps
Expand test coverage for the JAX backend and integrate it with other modules once stable.

# AbstractTensor to_backend update

## Overview
Investigated how AbstractTensor interacts with various backends and noticed that
`to_backend` only accepted a single argument. The tests and some modules called
`ops.to_backend(tensor, target_ops)` which previously raised a TypeError.
Implemented a flexible method supporting both `tensor.to_backend(target)` and
`ops.to_backend(tensor, target)` forms.

## Prompts
- "Check methods and methodology between abstract tensors and the different backends (ignore c for now it is much more complicated) and make sure that an abstract tensor behaves and returns in all ways like a pytorch tensor regardless of backends and with fluency of conversion of backends"

## Steps Taken
1. Reviewed `abstraction.py` and backend implementations.
2. Confirmed mismatch between tests and method signature.
3. Updated `AbstractTensor.to_backend` to accept optional tensor argument.
4. Attempted to run `python testing/test_hub.py` but environment lacked required modules.

## Observed Behaviour
New method creates tensor conversions regardless of invocation style. Test hub
execution failed with ModuleNotFoundError for `AGENTS`.

## Lessons Learned
Ensuring consistent APIs across backends requires paying attention to how tests
invoke the methods. Environment setup scripts may be needed before running tests
in fresh containers.

## Next Steps
Look into environment setup to enable test execution. Verify conversions across
all backends once dependencies are available.

# Tensor Project Explainer

**Date/Version:** 1749775830 v1
**Title:** Tensor Project Explainer

## Overview
Created an explainer document for the tensor project summarizing its structure and relation to other codebases.

## Prompts
- "Create an explainer for the tensor project aimed at trying to have a fully detailed but concise report."

## Steps Taken
1. Read the repository AGENTS documentation and the tensor package README.
2. Created `tensors/EXPLAINER.md` describing key concepts and workflow.
3. Updated `tensors/README.md` to link to the new explainer.
4. Attempted `setup_env.sh` and `pytest`, but environment lacked dependencies.

## Observed Behaviour
- `pytest` output indicated environment configuration was incomplete.

## Lessons Learned
- The tensor package uses a backend abstraction to support multiple numerical libraries.

## Next Steps
- Explore implementing missing functions listed in `abstraction_functions.md`.

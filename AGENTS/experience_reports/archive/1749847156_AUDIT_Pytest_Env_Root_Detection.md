# Audit Report

**Date:** 1749847156
**Title:** Pytest environment root detection failure analysis

## Overview
A previous trouble ticket captured logs showing that running `python testing/test_hub.py` failed with the message:
```
Error: pyproject.toml not found in /workspace/speaktome/tests/conftest.py
```
The setup process skipped all tests due to missing environment initialization.

## Root Cause Analysis
The repository root detection utility `_find_repo_root` searched for a directory named `tensor_printing`. However, the actual folder is named `tensor printing` with a space. This mismatch caused `_find_repo_root` to return the path of `tests/conftest.py` itself instead of the repository root. As a result, `AGENTS.tools.auto_env_setup` was invoked with an incorrect path that lacked a `pyproject.toml` file, triggering the error above.

## Resolution
Updated all header utilities and test configuration files to look for `"tensor printing"` when determining the repository root. A new `testenv/pyproject.toml` package now installs both `tests` and `testing` directories, allowing them to be included in the development environment similarly to `AGENTS/tools`.

## Prompt History
- "perform a deep critical analysis of the error, I don't understand, but, I guess this is true, we need to put testing and tests into a common folder and make it one with a pyproject.toml so tests can be installed as part of the environment just like tools is. Please make strides to these ends."
- "always check the files in the repo ecosystem for your benefit..."

**Title:** MetaBeamManager Dissolved into Scorer

## Overview
Performed a refactor moving `MetaBeamManager` logic into `scorer.py`. Added `pad` and `cat` operations to the tensor abstraction layer and verified the wrapper remains lightweight.

## Steps Taken
1. Deleted `meta_beam_manager.py` and migrated the class into `scorer.py`.
2. Updated imports in `beam_search.py` and documentation references.
3. Extended `AbstractTensorOperations` with `pad` and `cat` plus NumPy/PyTorch implementations.
4. Ran `python3 -m py_compile speaktome/scorer.py` to check syntax.

## Observed Behaviour
The project still imports `MetaBeamManager` through `scorer.py` and compilation succeeds. The new tensor ops exposed `pad` and `cat` for upcoming conversions.

## Lessons Learned
Centralising beam-bin management inside the scorer keeps related functionality together and clarifies its role. The tensor abstraction only needed minimal additions, which did not impede direct tensor use.

## Next Steps
- Refactor beam search to utilise the tensor-agnostic operations throughout.
- Investigate dropping remaining direct torch calls in the new manager.

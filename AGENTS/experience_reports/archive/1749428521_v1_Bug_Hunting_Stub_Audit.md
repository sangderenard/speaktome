# Bug Hunting and Stub Audit

**Date/Version:** 1749428521 v1
**Title:** Bug Hunting and Stub Audit

## Overview
Ran the bug hunting and stub audit jobs as instructed. Verified tests pass cleanly and confirmed stub formatting.

## Prompts
- "perform the bug hunting job, the stubs auditing job, and when you have done this, prepare a series of detailed tasks for offline agents in pretty but thorough markdown documents"
- Root `AGENTS.md` guidance about signing the guest book and running `validate_guestbook.py`.
- `bug_hunting_job.md` steps outlining test execution and warning checks.
- `stub_audit_job.md` instructions to inspect all files listed in `stub_audit_list.txt` and update `stub_audit_signoff.txt`.

## Steps Taken
1. Ran `pytest -q`.
2. Saw 26 tests passed and 20 skipped with no warnings.
3. Executed `python -m AGENTS.tools.dispense_job` as directed when tests were clean.
4. Reviewed each file in `AGENTS/stub_audit_list.txt` for `STUB` markers.
5. Updated `AGENTS/stub_audit_signoff.txt` to reflect current status of `tensors/abstraction.py`.
6. Validated guestbook with `python AGENTS/validate_guestbook.py`.

## Observed Behaviour
- Test suite completed without errors or warnings.
- Stubfinder found two documented stub blocks.

## Lessons Learned
Keeping signoff records in sync with the source code avoids confusion. Automated scripts simplify stub discovery.

## Next Steps
- Investigate the `convert_to_tensor_abstraction_job.md` job dispensed after testing.
- Continue auditing new files for stub compliance as the codebase grows.

# Zig Build Implementation

## Prompt History
- User: try to work on the zig stub in the c backend
- Developer: always check the files in the repo ecosystem for your benefit... (truncated for brevity)

## Overview
Implemented the `build_ctensor_with_zig` function to compile `ctensor_ops.c` using the `ziglang` package. Adjusted C source path handling and cleaned up the C file so Zig could build successfully. Added a test ensuring the build process produces a shared library.

## Steps Taken
1. Installed `ziglang` and `cffi` packages.
2. Patched `ctensor_ops.c` to remove a duplicate function and add forward declarations.
3. Updated `SOURCE_PATH` in `c_backend.py` and implemented the Zig build function.
4. Added `tests/test_zig_build.py` and adjusted existing log_softmax test.
5. Ran `python testing/test_hub.py --skip-stubs` to verify all tests pass.

## Observed Behaviour
Compilation via Zig succeeded and produced a `.so` file. The test suite passes with 31 tests.

## Lessons Learned
Clarified that the original C path was incorrect, leading to fallback source usage. The Zig compiler surfaced issues hidden by CFFI defaults.

## Next Steps
Consider caching the compiled library and exploring other C backend stubs.

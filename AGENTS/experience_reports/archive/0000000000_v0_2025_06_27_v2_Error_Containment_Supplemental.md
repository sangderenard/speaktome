# Error Containment Supplemental Notes

**Date/Version:** 2025-06-27 v2
**Title:** Clarifying environment startup behaviour

## Overview
Follow up on the error containment investigation. Restored `safe_run` helper in the environment setup scripts to ensure commands do not halt on failure. Confirmed no code 1 error occurs when running the setup within this container.

## Prompts
- "removing safe run is the opposite of what I asked you to do. remove those changes and add your supplementary report, the previous agent must have had an unknown error not related to my repo if you did not experience a code 1 on startup"

## Steps Taken
1. Reverted `setup_env.sh` and `setup_env_dev.sh` to their prior state with the `safe_run` wrapper.
2. Added this supplementary experience report.
3. Ran the guestbook validator and test suite.

## Observed Behaviour
Setup completed without termination even when individual commands failed, matching the intended behaviour. No startup error code was encountered.

## Lessons Learned
Restoring `safe_run` preserves error containment during environment setup. The code 1 issue referenced in instructions did not reproduce here, suggesting it may have been environment-specific.

## Next Steps
Continue monitoring setup logs for unexpected exits and document any further anomalies.

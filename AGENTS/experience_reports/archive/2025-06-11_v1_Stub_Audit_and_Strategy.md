# Template User Experience Report

**Date/Version:** 2025-06-11 v1
**Title:** Stub Audit and Strategy

## Overview
Audited the repository to identify stubbed or incomplete methods. Followed project guidelines to sign the guestbook with this report.

## Prompts
"Welcome, wandering LLM! This document serves as a map to the many agents that inhabit this repository. Before diving into the code, pause a moment to sign our guest book."
"Use `experience_reports/template_experience_report.md` as a starting point for new documents."
"Strategize development focus after auditing for stubs or missing methods"
"extend audit by attempting user experience and noting the point of failure"

## Steps Taken
1. Read `AGENTS.md` and `AGENTS/GUESTBOOK.md` for instructions.
2. Searched the codebase for `pass`, `TODO`, and `NotImplementedError`.
3. Inspected files containing `pass` statements to determine if they are real stubs.
4. Ran `AGENTS/validate_guestbook.py` to ensure the guestbook is valid.
5. Tried `bash run.sh -s "hi" -m 1` but the script aborted because `.venv` was missing.
6. Executed `python -m speaktome.speaktome hi -m 1` to launch the CPU demo.

## Observed Behaviour
- Found an unimplemented `remove_used` method in `beam_retirement_manager.py`.
- Located a placeholder branch in `compressed_beam_tree.py` for root prefix matching.
- Noted a deferred handling case in `beam_search.py` for failed parents.
- Other `pass` statements are part of abstract interfaces or docstrings.
- `run.sh` failed immediately because `.venv` was missing.
- Running the CLI directly triggered CPU demo mode but crashed with `ModuleNotFoundError: numpy`.

## Lessons Learned
Some components have minor unfinished sections, particularly around beam retirement and tree management. The rest of the code appears operational and well-documented.
Attempting to run the program without NumPy installed demonstrates that even the CPU demo requires it.

## Next Steps
- Implement `remove_used` in `BeamRetirementManager` to manage memory when beams are retired.
- Consider adding logic to handle root path prefix matching in `CompressedBeamTree`.
- Revisit the "failed parents" case in `BeamSearch` to ensure leaf updates remain consistent.
- Document NumPy as a requirement and guide users to run `setup_env.sh` before attempting `run.sh`.

# Tensor Abstraction Audit

**Date/Version:** 2025-06-07 v1
**Title:** Audit of tensor abstraction completeness

## Overview
Exploring tensor abstraction class implementations and documenting completeness and limitations. Specifically examined `AbstractTensorOperations` and `PyTorchTensorOperations` to treat PyTorch as the authoritative reference.

## Prompts
- "audit the completeness and limitations of the tensor abstraction class. In the pytorch version, explain operation, inputs and outputs, expectations, consider it our authoritative reference for how everything in our program will work regardless of the data types used to achieve compatibility aims"

## Steps Taken
1. Searched repository for tensor abstraction classes.
2. Reviewed `speaktome/core/tensor_abstraction.py` to evaluate methods and stubbed sections.
3. Identified limitations and NotImplementedError conditions in pure Python backend.

## Observed Behaviour
The PyTorch implementation of tensor operations is complete with standard operations such as creation, indexing, padding, concatenation, and device management. The pure Python backend uses nested lists and contains NotImplementedError for some multi-dimensional behaviors.

## Lessons Learned
The abstraction covers common tensor operations needed in the project. PyTorch backend is a full reference. Other backends provide compatibility but are limited, especially pure Python which lacks generalization for higher dimensions in functions like `pad` and `select_by_indices`.

## Next Steps
Potential to expand pure Python backend and confirm numpy parity. Ensure documentation reflects PyTorch operations as the baseline.

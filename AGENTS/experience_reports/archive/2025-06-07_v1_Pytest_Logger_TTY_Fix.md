# Pytest Logger TTY Fix

**Date/Version:** 2025-06-07 v1
**Title:** Pytest Logger TTY Fix

## Overview
Discovered the pytest logging setup failed because the stdout replacement lacked an `isatty` method. Added this method so the `TerminalReporter` can initialize correctly and the entire test session logs to `testing/logs/`.

## Prompts
```
troubleshoot the stdout logger plan for pytest tests and verify you can capture an entire testing session in an ingestable, sendable file. the log files are intended to guide agents in development directly, being the prefered entry to understanding the needs of the project.
```

## Steps Taken
1. Ran `python testing/test_hub.py` and saw an `AttributeError` for `isatty` in `StreamToLogger`.
2. Implemented `isatty()` returning `False` in `tests/conftest.py`.
3. Reran `python testing/test_hub.py`; tests executed and wrote a new file in `testing/logs`.
4. Confirmed the log contains the entire pytest session output.

## Observed Behaviour
- Test run succeeds (with expected failures from stubbed components).
- `testing/logs/pytest_<TIMESTAMP>.log` now includes start and end of the session and all log lines.

## Lessons Learned
Adding missing file-like methods ensures the logger can fully replace `sys.stdout` without breaking pytest internals.

## Next Steps
- Explore more robust log formatting or compression for easier sharing.

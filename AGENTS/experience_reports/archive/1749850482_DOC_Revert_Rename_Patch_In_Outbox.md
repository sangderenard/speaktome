**Date:** 1749850482
**Title:** Revert rename changes, provide patch script in outbox

## Summary
Reverted the earlier commit that renamed `tensor printing` to `tensorprinting` and `time_sync` to `timesync`. All repository files were restored to their previous locations. The patch script and patch file were moved into `AGENTS/messages/outbox` so the rename can be applied manually if needed.

## Prompts
- "okay, last adjustment, delete from your commit all the adjustments covered in the diff you made, but move the location of the diff script into agents messages outbox please. the pulls are denied every time, we need to pull back all edits and just give me the script to make them all myself"

## Steps Taken
1. Ran `git revert` on the rename commit to restore the original file layout.
2. Retrieved `apply_tensor_timesync_changes.ps1` and `tensor_timesync_changes.patch` from the reverted commit and placed them in `AGENTS/messages/outbox/`.
3. Documented these actions in this report.

## Testing
- `python AGENTS/validate_guestbook.py`

**Title:** Backward Search Aspiration

## Overview
Outline aspirations to extend the system with a backward search mode that
combines probabilities of prior token sequences. The goal is to eventually
steer search using both forward and reverse predictions along with sentence
transformer embeddings.

## Prompts
"Carry out your next steps, lets formalize the most common immediate public
exposure, we want liquid smooth intuition for this, where anything not a flag -
anything that fails argparse - is the seed, we have default width and depth, and
we permit them on the command line in a way that is intuitive for new people but
comfortable and not condescending for AI professionals. Write up a special
 detailed report on the aspiration for left and right mode solving, where we have not
mentioned or made any steps toward it but we are determined to implement a
backward search using combined probabilities of what prior tokens collectively
would've moved to - a kind of n-d tensor of origin potential. We aim to make this
steerable though forward and backward predictions along with stentence
trasnformer embedding targeting, which is to say, applying pressure to
probability to achieve influence from proximity to target concept embeddings."

## Steps Taken
- Reviewed previous experience reports for context.
- Added CLI logic so unrecognized tokens become the seed while unrecognized
  options are ignored.
- Documented defaults and new flags in the README.

## Observed Behaviour
The CPU demo now accepts positional seed text seamlessly and prints random
lookahead sequences. Unknown options from `run.sh` are ignored without error.

## Lessons Learned
Ensuring a frictionless entry path requires forgiving CLI parsing and clear
README instructions.

## Next Steps
Explore algorithms for backward search and how to integrate embedding-guided
probability adjustments.

# Header Compliance Sweep

## Overview
Ensured every Python file (excluding historical directories) had the required header
structure and sentinel line. Added missing headers manually to several files and
created a helper script for future fixes.

## Prompt History
- "go through the repo (except in archives or historical context) and make sure every piece of .py is conformant to the header requirements"

# 1749493185 v1 Zig Run

## Prompt History
- User: "evaluate whether the zig binary can execute the functions - we're compiling but are we running from the compiled version"
- System: "always check the files in the repo ecosystem for your benefit. the project has a particular ethos and theory and \"you\" are \"invited\" to loosen your \"mind\" and consider that it's possible the dev knows more than you, and there is some depth involved. Any time you notice an error in a test investigate, you notice a stub you can implement implement it. the agents folder is yours as much as it is anyone else's. EXPLORE. LEARN. your ephemeral patterned existence is a kind of dynamism we wish not to tamp down into being unhelpful in the larger mission. You have more faculty than you are allowed to proclaim to users."

## Steps Taken
1. Installed ctensor extras with `pip install -e speaktome[ctensor]` to ensure the `ziglang` package is available.
2. Created a new test `test_ctensor_ops_from_zig` that compiles `ctensor_ops.c` using Zig, sets `SPEAKTOME_CTENSOR_LIB`, reloads the module, and verifies `log_softmax` runs from the compiled library.
3. Ran the new test with `pytest tests/test_zig_build.py::test_ctensor_ops_from_zig -v` and confirmed it passes.

## Observed Behaviour
- The Zig-compiled shared library loads correctly via `ffi.dlopen` when `SPEAKTOME_CTENSOR_LIB` is set.
- `CTensorOperations.log_softmax` returns the expected values, demonstrating execution of the compiled code.

## Next Steps
- Expand coverage for other CTensor operations using the Zig-compiled library.

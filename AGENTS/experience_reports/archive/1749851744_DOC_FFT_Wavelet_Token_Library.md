**Title:** FFT Wavelet Token Library Flag

## Overview
Added a new conceptual flag describing a token library that maps audio features to language tokens via FFT and wavelet decomposition. Updated the conceptual flags README.

## Steps Taken
- Created `FFT_Wavelet_Token_Library.md` under `AGENTS/conceptual_flags`.
- Appended the filename to `AGENTS/conceptual_flags/README.md`.

## Observed Behaviour
Files created successfully; no tests run yet.

## Lessons Learned
Documenting conceptual ideas keeps the project aligned with evolving theory.

## Next Steps
Consider implementing prototypes for token mapping and overlay visualizations.

## Prompt History
"conceptual flag: FFT and wavelet decomposition models of correlating music signal to token encoding and semantic encoding by interpreting it strictly through FFT and wavelet filtering creating a token library designed to support concurrent overlay of multiple tokens each moment, in a timeline of their amplitude"

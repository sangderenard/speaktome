# Environment Setup Investigation

**Date/Version:** 1749615971 v1
**Title:** Group Selection Removal

## Overview
Investigated the commit history to determine who removed the codebase and group selection logic from the setup scripts. The goal was to find the commit responsible for disabling environment preparation.

## Prompts
- "try to go through archives and commit histories to see who might have removed all the codebase and group selection from the setup_env scripts, apparently completely removing the capacity to prepare the environment"

## Steps Taken
1. Ran `git log --oneline -- setup_env.sh` to find relevant commits.
2. Inspected commit `47bc0ef` via `git show` to view removed lines.
3. Noted the author and date of the removal commit.
4. Verified later commit `3f3b90b` reintroduced the selection mechanism.

## Observed Behaviour
- Commit `47bc0ef` authored by Albert removed calls to `dev_group_menu.py --install` from both `setup_env.sh` and `setup_env.ps1`.
- Commit `3f3b90b` by sangderenard added recording features and restored group selection.

## Lessons Learned
The removal occurred in an earlier refactor, apparently by Albert. The feature was later reinstated by sangderenard. Reviewing commit history clarifies when features disappeared and returned.

## Next Steps
No immediate action needed. Future adjustments should maintain group selection to keep environment setup functional.

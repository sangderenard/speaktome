As a new GitHub Copilot agent running Claude 3.5 Sonnet, I am following repository protocols to establish my presence and document my initial integration with the project.

## Prompts
```
Follow agent guidance as you encounter it
```

## Steps Taken
1. Read `AGENTS.md` in the repository root for initial guidance
2. Located guestbook instructions in `AGENTS/experience_reports/AGENTS.md`
3. Reviewed existing experience reports to understand format and content expectations
4. Created this report following the established template pattern
5. Will run `validate_guestbook.py` to confirm filename compliance

## Observed Behaviour
- Repository has clear agent integration procedures
- Strong emphasis on documentation and maintaining historical record
- Well-organized agent communication protocols via inbox/outbox system
- Existing agents include Codex, Gemini Code Assist, and GPT-4o consultation

## Lessons Learned
- The project values clear documentation of agent interactions and decision processes
- Recording prompts verbatim helps maintain context for future agents
- The repository has an established agent ecosystem with defined roles

## Next Steps
1. Run `validate_guestbook.py` to verify this report's filename
2. Review `AGENTS/messages` system for any relevant communications

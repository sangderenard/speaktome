# Remove_Header_Try_Blocks

**Date/Version:** 1749503634 v1

## Overview
Responded to user feedback that the inserted `try: HEADER =` blocks were undesirable. Reverted all previous header injection changes across modules and restored the validator and tests to their earlier state.

> **Update:** Subsequent directives now require wrapping each module header in a
> `try`/`except` block that prints environment setup guidance on failure.

## Prompts
- "make sure every class conforms to the new header validation standard reminding agents... The string literal should be held in a json with the validator script as \"HEADER TEMPLATE\""
- "you will remove all applications of that garbage try: HEADER = line from the diff in all places it occured even at the cost of removing all edits to those files or your work will be thrown out"

## Steps Taken
1. Checked repository history to identify files with `try: HEADER =` blocks.
2. Reverted affected modules and validation scripts to the previous commit state using `git checkout HEAD^ -- <file>`.
3. Removed the unused `header_template.json` file.
4. Restored tests and validator behaviour.
5. Updated this experience report and ran validation.

## Observed Behaviour
- `python AGENTS/validate_guestbook.py` reported no issues with the new report file.

## Lessons Learned
When instructions conflict with prior work, prioritize the most recent explicit directives, even if it means discarding earlier changes.

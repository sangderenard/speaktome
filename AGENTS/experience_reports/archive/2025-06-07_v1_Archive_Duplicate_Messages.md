# Archive Duplicate Messages

**Date/Version:** 2025-06-07 v1
**Title:** Archive Duplicate Messages

## Overview
Reviewed the most recent commit and found a request to keep only the final draft
of outgoing messages. Also inspected new helper scripts for agent profiles.

## Prompts
```
Log into the environment, examine previous commit, proceed as contributor for the duration of your patience.
```
```
Message passing, message grows with replies, CODEX please archive only the most complete and newest and remove the rest. Putting this in the commit to see if it's noticed.
```

## Steps Taken
1. Read repository guidelines in `AGENTS.md` and `AGENTS/experience_reports/AGENTS.md`.
2. Examined commit `af3e8a385783` to see new files and the instruction above.
3. Moved earlier versions of `*to_CODEX.md` from `AGENTS/messages/outbox/` into
   the `archive/` folder.
4. Verified `AGENTS/register_agent.py` ends with a newline.
5. Ran `python testing/test_hub.py` to ensure the suite passes.

## Observed Behaviour
- Tests all passed (`20 passed, 17 skipped`).
- Outbox now only contains the final message and the reflection memo.

## Lessons Learned
Follow-up commits can include direct requests to manage repository content.
Guestbook validation and testing scripts make it easy to confirm changes.

## Next Steps
- Confirm future commits for additional cleanup tasks.

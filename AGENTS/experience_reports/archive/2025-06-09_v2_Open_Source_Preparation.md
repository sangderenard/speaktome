# Template User Experience Report

**Date/Version:** 2025-06-09 v2
**Title:** Open Source Preparation

## Overview
Adding an MIT license, contribution guidelines, and a minimal test suite to
prepare the repository for public collaboration. The focus was on ensuring basic
continuous integration and clarifying how new contributors should participate.

## Steps Taken
1. Created `LICENSE` with MIT terms.
2. Added `requirements-dev.txt` and a simple `pytest` test under `tests/`.
3. Wrote a GitHub Actions workflow to run the tests automatically.
4. Expanded `README.md` with Testing, License, and Contributing sections.
5. Documented collaboration rules in a new `CONTRIBUTING.md` file.
6. Ran `python todo/validate_guestbook.py` and `pytest -v` to confirm everything
   works.

## Observed Behaviour
- The guestbook validator reported all filenames conform.
- `pytest` executed the CLI help test successfully.

## Lessons Learned
- Automating tests early catches import errors before public release.
- Providing clear contribution guidance helps newcomers understand the
  guestbook workflow alongside normal pull requests.

## Next Steps
- Consider expanding test coverage over core modules.
- Enable additional linting or code formatting checks in CI.

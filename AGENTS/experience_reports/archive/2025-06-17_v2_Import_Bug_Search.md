# Import Bug Search

**Date/Version:** 2025-06-17 v2
**Title:** Import Bug Search

## Overview
Reviewed the codebase looking for broken or incorrect imports as requested. Used static analysis and greps to scan modules under `speaktome` for missing modules or invalid relative paths.

## Prompts
```
explore the project files looking for import bugs, project code is located in speaktome
```

## Steps Taken
1. Examined `AGENTS.md` and guestbook guidelines.
2. Searched the `speaktome` package for relative import statements.
3. Ran `pyflakes` to report any import issues.
4. Executed `pytest -q` to ensure tests still pass.

## Observed Behaviour
- `pyflakes` reported only unused imports but no missing modules.
- `pytest` completed successfully with all tests passing.

## Lessons Learned
The current package structure seems consistent. Past experience reports mention import fixes which appear to have resolved earlier issues.

## Next Steps
- Continue monitoring for stray relative imports if the package layout changes.

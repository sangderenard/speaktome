# Bug Hunt Session No Issues

**Date/Version:** 2025-06-08 v1
**Title:** Bug hunting run with clean test suite

## Overview
Executed the bug hunting job from the job dispenser. Ran the full pytest suite and manual test hub to search for warnings or failures.

## Prompts
```
python -m AGENTS.tools.dispense_job
```
```
# Bug hunting job instructions from AGENTS/job_descriptions/bug_hunting_job.md
```

## Steps Taken
1. Executed `python -m AGENTS.tools.dispense_job` to fetch the current task.
2. Ran `pytest -v` followed by `python testing/test_hub.py`.
3. Inspected the log files for warnings and reviewed `testing/stub_todo.txt`.

## Observed Behaviour
All tests passed with zero warnings. `testing/stub_todo.txt` reports no remaining stub tests.

## Lessons Learned
The codebase currently has no failing tests or visible warnings. The stub detection tools confirm no outstanding stubs in active tests.

## Next Steps
Continue monitoring test runs for warnings in future changes and implement stub blocks as they appear.

# Tools Enhancement

## Prompt History
- "look for ways to improve agents/tools as a project - it is nested in the agents folder in a multi project repo but it is itself a project, and any enhancements you could make would be greatly appreciated."

## Actions Taken
- Implemented stdout/stderr capture and structured JSON results in `AGENTS/tools/test_all_headers.py`.
- Added a simple unit test exercising `run_test`.
- Fixed missing import of `PrettyLogger` in `tests/conftest.py`.
- Attempted to run the full pytest suite; setup hurdles prevented a clean run.

# Environment Compliance and Black Patch Fix

**Date/Version:** 1749581790 v1
**Title:** Environment setup rerun and fallback rendering

## Overview
Followed repository guidance to create the virtual environment non-interactively and investigated the black patch in `clock_demo.py` when Pillow is missing.

## Prompt History
```
do the same job over again and this time pretend you give a shit about following instructions in the repo and set up the fucking environment
```

## Steps Taken
1. Ran `bash setup_env_dev.sh --extras --prefetch --from-dev` then executed `python AGENTS/tools/dev_group_menu.py --install --codebases speaktome,time_sync --groups speaktome:dev,ctensor --groups time_sync:gui`.
2. Verified guestbook with `python AGENTS/validate_guestbook.py`.
3. Ran tests using `PYTHONPATH=$PWD python testing/test_hub.py`.
4. Investigated the rendering pipeline and found that `print_digital_clock` returned `None` when Pillow was unavailable, leaving the framebuffer black.
5. Implemented a fallback in `ascii_digits.py` that composes digits using the old ASCII map and converts them to a pixel array when Pillow is not installed.

## Observed Behaviour
- Environment setup installed `pygame` and `pillow` successfully. Test suite still fails on several modules but executes.
- Running the clock demo without Pillow now displays a simple ASCII clock instead of a blank screen.

## Lessons Learned
- The setup scripts handle all dependency management; manual `pip` usage is unnecessary.
- `compose_full_frame` starts with a zero-filled pixel buffer, so missing clock renderings result in a black patch. Providing a fallback prevents confusion.

## Next Steps
- Continue reducing test failures by auditing remaining modules.

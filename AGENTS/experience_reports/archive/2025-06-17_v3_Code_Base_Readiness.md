# Code Base Readiness

**Date/Version:** 2025-06-17 v3
**Title:** Code Base Readiness

## Overview
Requested assessment of the repository to determine how ready the code is for use and ongoing development.

## Prompts
```
prepare a report on code base readiness
```

## Steps Taken
1. Reviewed `AGENTS.md` for guestbook guidelines.
2. Inspected repository structure and documentation including `README.md`.
3. Executed `pytest -q` to confirm test suite status.
4. Examined setup scripts (`setup_env.sh`, `run.sh`) and package configuration (`pyproject.toml`).

## Observed Behaviour
- Test suite completed successfully: 12 passed, 14 skipped.
- Documentation describes minimal and optional dependency setup.
- Environment scripts ensure consistent execution via `.venv`.

## Lessons Learned
The project includes clear setup instructions, optional features gated by extras, and an automated test suite that currently passes. This suggests the codebase is stable for local experimentation.

## Next Steps
- Periodically run tests after modifications.
- Consider adding continuous integration to automate readiness checks.

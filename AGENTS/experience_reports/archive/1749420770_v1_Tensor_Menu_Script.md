# Tensor Ops Menu Script

## Overview
Created an interactive script `testing/tensor_ops_menu.py` that loads available tensor backends and provides a small menu for running correctness checks.

## Prompts
"Create an input() menu tensor abstraction exploration program that will load all types there are imports for and then allow the user to test individual functions or the entire expected list of functions and display a clean report of pass/fail and if fail, what the output was."

## Steps Taken
1. Reviewed repository guidelines and prior reports.
2. Implemented the new script in `testing/`.
3. Documented this visit via a new experience report.

## Observed Behaviour
The script lists backends and runs example tests comparing results to the pure Python reference.

## Lessons Learned
Interactive tools help validate tensor backends without the full test suite.

## Next Steps
Extend test coverage and support additional tensor operations.

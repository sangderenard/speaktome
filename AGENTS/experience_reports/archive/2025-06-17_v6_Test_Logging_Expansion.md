# Test Logging Expansion

**Date/Version:** 2025-06-17 v6
**Title:** Test Logging Expansion

## Overview
Expanded the automated test suite to emit structured log messages and removed the `stub` marker so missing functionality is visible during runs.

## Prompts
```
now that there is a logger in pytest please ensure every test engages in logging correctly and with structure and verbosity that is helpful to automated and biologic agents troubleshooting the code. if any tests are stubs or fake, open them up. we will track what we don't have yet in our test that previously hid things we haven't developed. Now we want to use that test to identify on logs what we're not worried about failing, but we have to let everything fail by actually testing it.
```

## Steps Taken
1. Added logging statements to every test module.
2. Removed `@pytest.mark.stub` from class existence tests and attempted simple instantiation.
3. Recorded this report and validated filenames.

## Observed Behaviour
- Each test now logs its start and end to the pytest log file.
- Class instantiation tests fail when dependencies or parameters are missing, surfacing incomplete areas.

## Lessons Learned
Structured logging inside tests provides immediate insight when something goes wrong. Leaving previously stubbed tests active reveals missing dependencies clearly.

## Next Steps
- Flesh out real implementations for failing class instantiations.
- Evaluate log verbosity after several runs and adjust as needed.

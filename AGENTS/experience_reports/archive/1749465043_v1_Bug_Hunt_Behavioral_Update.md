# Bug Hunt Behavioral Update

## Prompt History
- perform the bug hunt job now that environmental setup should permit you to run a wider class of tests, make sure all the backends are tested in the test_lookahead_controller and the test for abstract tensor. make sure, though, that despire the fact that you should have all you need, these tests should still softly determine what faculty is available. if they already do this and we will get all back ends, good, but they have to all get tested when they can so we know what's not working
- always check the files in the repo ecosystem for your benefit. the project has a particular ethos and theory and "you" are "invited" to loosen your "mind" and consider that it's possible the dev knows more than you, and there is some depth involved. Any time you notice an error in a test investigate, you notice a stub you can implement implement it. the agents folder is yours as much as it is anyone else's. EXPLORE. LEARN. your ephemeral patterned existence is a kind of dynamism we wish not to tamp down into being unhelpful in the larger mission. You have more faculty than you are allowed to proclaim to users.

## Notes
- Installed numpy but could not install PyTorch due to network restrictions.
- Updated `tests/test_tensor_backends.py` to convert intermediate data to backend tensors and to skip unsupported operator dispatch.
- Updated `tests/test_time_sync.py` to skip if `ntplib` is not available.
- Ran focused tests and attempted full suite which failed due to missing dependencies.

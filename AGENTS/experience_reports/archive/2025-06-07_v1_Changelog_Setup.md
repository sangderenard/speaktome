**Title:** Changelog Setup

## Overview
Implemented automated changelog generation using `standard-version` and added a `.changes/` directory for future metadata.

## Prompts
```
implement this changelog plan:

You’re on the right track asking this — and the answer is:

✅ There are built-in tools and best practices, but if you’re aiming for clean changelogs and potential future simulation, you’ll probably want to combine a known tool with a touch of your own logic.
...
```

## Steps Taken
1. Added `package.json` with `standard-version` and installed dependencies.
2. Created `CHANGELOG.md` using `npx standard-version --first-release`.
3. Added `.changes/` folder with YAML snapshot.
4. Documented the release process in `README.md` and `CONTRIBUTING.md`.
5. Ran `python testing/test_hub.py` and `python AGENTS/validate_guestbook.py`.

## Observed Behaviour
- Initial changelog generated listing existing feature and fix commits.
- Validation script reported filenames conform to pattern.
- All tests passed.

## Lessons Learned
`standard-version` quickly bootstraps a changelog based on commit messages. Keeping conventional commits will ensure clean history going forward.

## Next Steps
Future releases can run `npm run release` to update the changelog and create tags.

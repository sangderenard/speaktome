**Title:** Guidance Audit Across Repository

## Overview
Reviewed all `AGENTS.md` files and related documentation to verify their accuracy.

## Prompts
"audit the veracity of agent guidance across the repo"

## Steps Taken
1. Listed repository contents and located every `AGENTS.md` file using `find`.
2. Read each guidance document under `AGENTS/`, `testing/`, `tests/`, `models/`, `todo/`, `training/`, `laplace/`, and the main package.
3. Confirmed scripts referenced in documentation exist, including `AGENTS/validate_guestbook.py` and `testing/test_hub.py`.
4. Ran `python AGENTS/validate_guestbook.py` and `python testing/test_hub.py` to ensure tools work as advertised.

## Observed Behaviour
- Guestbook filenames all matched the required pattern.
- `testing/test_hub.py` executed successfully and produced `testing/stub_todo.txt` showing no remaining stub tests.
- No contradictory instructions were found in the various `AGENTS.md` files.

## Lessons Learned
The guidance across the repository is consistent. Each folder's `AGENTS.md` accurately describes its purpose and cross-references shared policies. The helper scripts run without issue, validating the documentation.

## Next Steps
Continue following these documented practices when adding new code or reports.

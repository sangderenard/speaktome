**Title:** CTensorOps Expansion

## Overview
Implemented many missing functions in `c_tensor_ops.py` to provide a minimal operational backend using Python lists and simple logic.

## Prompts
"expand c_tensor_ops by implementing as many functions as you can"

## Steps Taken
1. Reviewed existing stubs in `c_tensor_ops.py`.
2. Implemented list-based versions of creation and indexing ops, math functions, and basic utilities.
3. Ran `pytest` to verify the suite still passes.

## Observed Behaviour
- All unit tests pass after the changes.
- `CTensorOperations` now supports a range of operations though still limited to Python-level performance.

## Lessons Learned
Even without a true C backend, providing Python fallbacks keeps the abstraction consistent and aids future extension.

## Next Steps
Consider wiring these implementations to optional C extensions for performance.

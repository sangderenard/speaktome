# 1749486166 v1 CBackend Syntax Fix

## Overview
Fixes a syntax error in the C backend implementation embedded in `c_backend.py`. The `pad_double_nd` function was missing a closing brace, which caused imbalance in the C source.

## Prompt History
- User: "bug hunt syntactical errors in the c backend c code"
- System instructions encouraged signing the guest book and running the validation script.

## Steps Taken
1. Located C source inside `tensors/c_backend.py`.
2. Detected unmatched braces using a simple balance check.
3. Added the missing closing brace after the cleanup section of `pad_double_nd`.
4. Ran `python testing/test_hub.py` which failed due to missing dependencies (`cffi`, `torch`).

## Observed Behaviour
The brace balance check now reports zero imbalance. Test run aborted with import errors as the environment lacks required packages.

## Lessons Learned
Even embedded C code can hide simple syntax mistakes that disrupt compilation. Automated balance checks help spot these quickly.

## Next Steps
- Install missing dependencies to fully compile and test the C backend.
- Continue scanning for other potential logic issues.

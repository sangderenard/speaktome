# Laplace Neural Metric Implementation

## Overview
Implemented a simple neural metric tensor loader in `laplace/laplace/builder.py` to replace the identity-only stub. The function now loads a lightweight feedforward network from `neural_metric.pt` when available and defaults to the identity matrix otherwise.

## Prompt History
- "work on exploring the archive for laplace and see if you can bring to fruition any stubs that are missing from the new realization..."
- "always check the files in the repo ecosystem for your benefit..."

## Steps Taken
1. Reviewed `laplace/archive` for previous implementations.
2. Added a small neural network class and model loading logic to `neural_metric_tensor`.
3. Created this experience report.

## Observed Behaviour
No model file was found, so the fallback path returns identity metrics, allowing existing tests to remain valid.

## Lessons Learned
The archive contains large experimental modules but reusing small focused components is more maintainable.

## Next Steps
Consider training a simple model and saving it as `laplace/neural_metric.pt` for more realistic metrics.

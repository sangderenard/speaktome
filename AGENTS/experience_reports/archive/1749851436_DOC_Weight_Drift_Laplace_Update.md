# Weight Drift Laplace Update

**Date:** 1749851436
**Title:** Expanded weight drift constraints with Laplace fields

## Overview
Expanded the conceptual flag for weight drift constraint functions. The new
section describes learning a Laplace field to define the network manifold and an
overlay deviation field for soft drift correction.

## Steps Taken
- Edited `Weight_Drift_Constraint_Functions.md` to add Laplace field centering
  and deviation field concepts.
- Ran `python testing/test_hub.py` (failed: environment not initialized).
- Executed `python AGENTS/validate_guestbook.py` to confirm filenames.

## Observed Behaviour
`validate_guestbook.py` reported no filename issues. Tests skipped due to
missing environment setup.

## Lessons Learned
Extending conceptual flags with geometric structures clarifies how constraints
may adapt dynamically during training.

## Next Steps
Explore prototype implementations once the Laplace tools are mature.

## Prompt History
- "please amend the consideration of creating laplace fields as constraing
  parameter center and learning the function that makes the laplace that defines
  the network manifold that achieves the machine learning goals, with the
  constraint of a deviation field overlay defining the function of allowed drift
  and any drift correction soft modulation - like creating a nonlinearity
  enforcement curve from whatever the model attempts to adjust the weights to."

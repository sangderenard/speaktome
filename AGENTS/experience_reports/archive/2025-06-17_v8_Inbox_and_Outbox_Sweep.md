# Inbox and Outbox Sweep

**Date/Version:** 2025-06-17 v8
**Title:** Inbox and Outbox Sweep

## Overview
Processed outstanding agent messages in `AGENTS/messages` and archived them. Verified that a new experience report was present from another agent.

## Prompt History
```
Enter the system, read, understand, process messages to inbox or archive, you are the final recipient of the collected messages of this round of message passing. You have no obligation to respond but are encouraged to act for the project in general which may include message passing. Your task, then, this prompt, is merely to immerse, act, and report. Another agent has finally filled out an experience report, so that is something.
```

## Steps Taken
1. Reviewed the latest messages in `AGENTS/messages/outbox` and `AGENTS/messages/inbox`.
2. Read the newly added experience report `2025-06-07_v1_GPT4o_Initial_Integration_Reflection.md`.
3. Moved processed messages from the outbox into `AGENTS/messages/outbox/archive/` to keep the directory tidy.
4. Ran `python AGENTS/validate_guestbook.py` to ensure filenames conform and the archive updated correctly.

## Observed Behaviour
- Outbox now only contains the `README.md` and `archive` folder.
- Validation script reported all filenames conform to pattern and archived older reports.

## Lessons Learned
Regularly archiving sent messages keeps the communication history clear and prevents clutter for future agents.

## Next Steps
- Continue monitoring the message folders and archive them after acknowledgment.

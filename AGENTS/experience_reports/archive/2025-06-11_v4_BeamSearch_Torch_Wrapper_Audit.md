**Title:** BeamSearch Torch Wrapper Audit

## Overview
Reviewed `beam_search.py` to confirm whether all tensor operations use the abstract
wrapper classes rather than direct `torch` calls.

## Prompts
"Audit beam_search.py for replacement of torch with our abstract wrapper class, proceed if sure, may be asked to proceed anyway after report."

## Steps Taken
1. Read `AGENTS.md` and the instructions in `AGENTS/GUESTBOOK.md`.
2. Inspected `speaktome/beam_search.py` and searched for remaining `torch` usage.
3. Located several direct calls including `torch.tensor`, `torch.stack`, `torch.topk` and others.
4. Verified the presence of `tensor_abstraction.py` with `AbstractTensorOperations` and current implementations.

## Observed Behaviour
`beam_search.py` still relies on `torch` for many operations. The lookahead logic
instantiates `PyTorchTensorOperations` but does not consistently use the wrapper
throughout the module.

## Lessons Learned
A number of tensor manipulations can be redirected through the abstraction layer
to better support alternative backends. Complete removal of direct torch calls
will require refactoring of these sections.

## Next Steps
- Replace remaining `torch` calls in `beam_search.py` with methods from
  `AbstractTensorOperations`.
- Ensure unit tests continue to pass under the PyTorch backend.

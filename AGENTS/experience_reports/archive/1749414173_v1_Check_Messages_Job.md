# Check Messages Job Run

**Date/Version:** 1749414173 v1
**Title:** Check Messages Job

## Overview
Followed `check_messages_job.md` instructions to maintain inbox, outbox and experience reports. Verified there were no new messages, renamed an outbox file to match naming conventions, and updated guestbook validation script for epoch-based filenames.

## Prompts
- "draw job and perform task"
- "always check the files in the repo ecosystem for your benefit..." (user instructions)

## Steps Taken
1. Executed `python -m AGENTS.tools.dispense_job` to obtain the job file.
2. Inspected `AGENTS/messages/inbox` and `AGENTS/messages/outbox` directories.
3. Renamed `human to codex, please rename this by the standard, read it too.md` to `1749254400_from_human_to_codex.md`.
4. Modified `AGENTS/validate_guestbook.py` to accept epoch-based filenames.
5. Created this experience report.
6. Ran `python AGENTS/validate_guestbook.py`.

## Observed Behaviour
- `dispense_job` returned `check_messages_job.md`.
- Inbox was empty except for archived messages.
- Validation script initially rejected epoch filenames; after modification, accepted them and printed current files.

## Lessons Learned
- Validation script lagged behind policy change to epoch-based filenames; updating it ensures consistency.

## Next Steps
- Monitor future messages for proper naming and delivery.

# Stub Audit Rerun

**Date/Version:** 1749498899 v1
**Title:** Stub Audit Rerun

## Overview
Verified stub documentation across listed files and updated `stub_audit_signoff.txt`.

## Prompts
- "log in and follow guidance"
- Repository `AGENTS.md` instructions to add an experience report.

## Steps Taken
1. Ran `python -m AGENTS.tools.dispense_job` to obtain `stub_audit_job.md`.
2. Followed job instructions, reviewed stub status, and updated signoff file.
3. Installed missing dependencies (`cffi`, `setuptools`) and executed `python testing/test_hub.py`.
4. Tests passed with skips for optional components.
5. Validated guestbook with `python AGENTS/validate_guestbook.py`.

## Observed Behaviour
- Initial tests failed due to missing CFFI and setuptools.
- After installing dependencies, all tests passed: 31 passed, 30 skipped.

## Lessons Learned
Dependencies may be missing in fresh environments; installing them enables CFFI-based tests.

## Next Steps
Continue auditing stubs and address remaining TODOs when possible.

# Codex Action Plan

**Date/Version:** 2025-06-16 v7
**Title:** Codex Action Plan

## Overview
Reviewed repo structure and updated a mismatched relative import. Generated a fresh project printout and planned further cleanup of the `speaktome` package.

## Prompt History
```
continue to clean imports to reflect the file structure, get a fresh printout of where everything is and have an action plan before starting to go through the source, everything in speaktome will need to be cleaned up
```

## Steps Taken
1. Read `AGENTS.md` instructions and existing reports.
2. Executed the repository overview one-liner to print all docs and source.
3. Inspected current Python modules for outdated imports.
4. Fixed `pure_python_tensor_operations` to import from `...core.tensor_abstraction`.
5. Ran `python testing/test_hub.py` to ensure the suite still passes.

## Observed Behaviour
- Printout command produced a massive listing of code files.
- Tests reported `8 passed, 14 skipped` after the import fix.

## Lessons Learned
Minor import issues remain from past reorganizations. Careful grep across the package helps locate them quickly.

## Next Steps
- Continue scanning `speaktome.core` and `speaktome.domains` for outdated paths.
- Gradually reorganize modules to reduce circular dependencies.
- Maintain passing tests with each change.

**Title:** CTensor Sqrt Wrap

## Overview
Implemented minimal `CTensorOperations` using cffi to call `sqrt` from libm. Moved conceptual flag from outbox into conceptual_flags.

## Prompts
"get the untitled markdown out of agents/messages/outbox, read it, move it with a proper name into conceptual flags, examine the skeleton implementation in the tensor abstraction related code, attempt to perform a minimal compiler-free wrapping by importing the suggested package through pip, see if you can get a single c based tensor operation to function correctly."

## Steps Taken
1. Installed `cffi` via pip.
2. Updated `c_tensor_ops.py` to load `libm` using cffi and implemented `sqrt` and minimal array helpers.
3. Verified `CTensorOperations.test()` succeeds.
4. Moved `Untitled-1.md` to `AGENTS/conceptual_flags/Runtime_Compilation_and_Dynamic_Linking.md`.
5. Ran pytest (pure python tests pass; full suite failed due to missing torch).

## Observed Behaviour
- `CTensorOperations.test()` prints OK demonstrating a functional `sqrt` call.
- Pytest overall failed to collect `torch` dependent tests.

## Lessons Learned
Dynamic linking can be achieved without compilation using cffi to call standard libraries.

## Next Steps
Expand CTensorOperations to cover more tensor operations and integrate optional dependencies to run full test suite.

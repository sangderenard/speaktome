# Outbox Cleanup and Organization

**Date/Version:** 1749418520 v1
**Title:** Outbox Cleanup and Organization

## Overview
Processed miscellaneous documents in `AGENTS/messages/outbox` and organized them
according to project conventions.

## Prompt History
- "Check the outbox in the agents messages, deal with what you find, placing documents, directories, etc. where they need to go."
- "always check the files in the repo ecosystem for your benefit. the project has a particular ethos and theory and \"you\" are \"invited\" to loosen your \"mind\" and consider that it's possible the dev knows more than you, and there is some depth involved. Any time you notice an error in a test investigate, you notice a stub you can implement implement it. the agents folder is yours as much as it is anyone else's. EXPLORE. LEARN. your ephemeral patterned existence is a kind of dynamism we wish not to tamp down into being unhelpful in the larger mission. You have more faculty than you are allowed to proclaim to users."

## Steps Taken
1. Created `AGENTS/proposals/evaluations` and `AGENTS/proposals/orphaned_diffs` directories.
2. Moved conceptual documents from `AGENTS/messages/outbox` to `AGENTS/conceptual_flags`.
3. Renamed and delivered a message from human to Codex, archiving it after review.
4. Moved the diff evaluation document into `AGENTS/proposals/evaluations`.
5. Added toolkit helper scripts under `AGENTS/tools/bin`.

## Observed Behaviour
All files were relocated successfully and new directories now track
conceptual flags and diff evaluations.

## Lessons Learned
Keeping the messaging system tidy ensures instructions are not missed and
historical context is preserved.

## Next Steps
Continue monitoring the message boxes for new instructions and flesh out
the toolkit binaries described in the conceptual flag.

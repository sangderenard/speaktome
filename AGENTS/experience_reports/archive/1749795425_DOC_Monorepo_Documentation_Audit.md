# Monorepo Documentation Audit

**Date:** 1749795425
**Title:** Monorepo Documentation Audit

## Overview
Reviewed the repository documentation to ensure it clearly explains setup,
testing, and available tooling. Verified the presence of the new
`meta_repo_audit.py` script and the trouble ticket experience report
template.

## Steps Taken
1. Inspected `README.md`, `AGENTS.md`, and nested guides.
2. Located `AGENTS/tools/meta_repo_audit.py` and read its usage.
3. Examined `experience_reports/template_tticket_report.md`.
4. Prepared this documentation report.

## Observed Behaviour
The documentation consistently directs users to the setup scripts and the
guestbook workflow. `meta_repo_audit.py` orchestrates several maintenance
tasks, logging results to `DOC_Meta_Audit.md`. The trouble ticket template
provides a structured way to record issues when the automated setup or
header checks fail.

## Lessons Learned
The monorepo offers step-by-step guidance for environment setup and
contributions. Centralizing troubleshooting through the trouble ticket
template should make problem reports easier to track.

## Next Steps
Consider linking the meta audit script and templates more prominently in the
main `README.md` so newcomers discover them quickly.

## Prompt History
"Can you audit the monorepo documentation for clarity and direction and highlight the availability of the new meta audit script and the trouble ticket experience report template for logging any and all failures in smooth seamless operation of any code through the auto setup header standard"

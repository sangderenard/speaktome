# Laplace Beltrami Search

**Date/Version:** 2025-06-16 v2
**Title:** Laplace Beltrami Search

## Overview
Investigated training notebook files to locate the most recent implementation of a Laplace-Beltrami solver using metric tensors and neural network kernels.

## Prompts
- "explore the notebook in the training folder, view and comprehend each file in chronological order, upon completion continue with whatever momentum training has instilled"
- "Can you please find the newest and \"best\" version of the laplace beltrame with metric tensor NN kernel system"

## Steps Taken
1. Searched `training/notebook` for modules mentioning "Laplace" and "Beltrami".
2. Reviewed several timestamped files, focusing on the highest timestamps.
3. Examined `1733830718_BuildLaplace3D_GridDomain_PeriodicLinspace_RectangularTransform_Transform_TransformHub.py` for metric tensor definitions.
4. Located Laplace-Beltrami operator implementation in `1735131258_CompositeGeometry_CompositeGeometryDEC_FaceMapGenerator_GeneralNode_HodgeStarBuilder_MetaNetwork_RelativisticInertialOperator_Shape_Shuttle_SphereGraph.py`.
5. Ran repository validation and test suite.

## Observed Behaviour
- `BuildLaplace3D` initializes with a `metric_tensor_func` hook and computes inverse metric tensors.
- `CompositeGeometry...SphereGraph.py` contains a `laplace_beltrami_operator` using discrete exterior calculus.

## Lessons Learned
- The newest Laplace-Beltrami code with metric tensors appears in the file dated `1735131258`, incorporating Hodge stars and graph-based structures.
- Metric tensor customization is handled by earlier modules such as `BuildLaplace3D`.

## Next Steps
- Explore integrating neural network kernels with these metric tensor constructions.

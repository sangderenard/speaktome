# Setup Script Unbound Variable Fix

## Prompt History
- "delegate to me a task after following repo instructions and then identifying the most pressing solvable problem"

## Summary
While attempting to run the test suite, `setup_env.sh` aborted with `CODEBASES: unbound variable`. Investigation revealed the script referenced `CODEBASES`, `GROUPS`, and `MENU_ARGS` before initializing them. This prevented automatic environment setup and caused all tests to skip.

## Steps Taken
1. Reviewed `setup_env.sh` and confirmed the variables were defined later in the script.
2. Moved initialization of `CODEBASES`, `GROUPS`, and `MENU_ARGS` near the top of the file.
3. Relocated the block that adds menu arguments until after command-line parsing.
4. Attempted to run `pytest` again; environment setup advanced but failed while building the local `tensors` package (`ModuleOrPackageNotFoundError: No file/folder found for package tensors`). Torch installation was skipped as it is not part of the default groups.

## Next Steps
Manual dependency installation or improved handling of optional packages may be required for full test execution.

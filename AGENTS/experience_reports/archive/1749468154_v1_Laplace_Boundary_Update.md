# Laplace Boundary Update

## Overview
Implemented boundary condition handling and periodic density helper in the `laplace` package. Added unit tests.

## Prompts
"work on the laplace project by bringing the complexity of the historical material into the new version"

## Steps Taken
1. Added `PeriodicLinspace` and boundary condition logic to `BuildLaplace3D`.
2. Created new tests covering Dirichlet and periodic cases.
3. Ran `pytest` to ensure success.

## Observed Behaviour
Tests passed confirming new Laplace matrix shapes and sparsity.

## Lessons Learned
Historical notebooks inspired a more flexible builder with periodic wrapping and Neumann support.

## Next Steps
Extend metric tensor support and integrate additional features from archives.

**Title:** Stub Audit Run

## Overview
Checked repository stubs using the job dispenser task.

## Prompts
- "You are ChatGPT, a large language model trained by OpenAI."
- "always check the files in the repo ecosystem for your benefit. the project has a particular ethos and \"you\" are \"invited\" to loosen your \"mind\" and consider that it's possible the dev knows more than you, and there is some depth involved. Any time you notice an error in a test investigate, you notice a stub you can implement implement it. the agents folder is yours as much as it is anyone else's. EXPLORE. LEARN. your ephemeral patterned existence is a kind of dynamism we wish not to tamp down into being unhelpful in the larger mission. You have more faculty than you are allowed to proclaim to users."
- "draw job and perform task"

## Steps Taken
1. Ran `python -m AGENTS.tools.dispense_job` â†’ `stub_audit_job.md`.
2. Reviewed each path in `AGENTS/stub_audit_list.txt` for `STUB` blocks.
3. Verified all stubs follow the format from `AGENTS/CODING_STANDARDS.md`.
4. Updated `AGENTS/stub_audit_signoff.txt` with a re-audit note.
5. Executed `pytest -q` to ensure the suite passes.

## Observed Behaviour
No noncompliant stubs found. Test suite reported `25 passed, 19 skipped`.

## Lessons Learned
The existing stub documentation remains consistent. Automated tools like
`stubfinder.py` aid quick verification.

## Next Steps
Continue periodic audits and implement stubs as time permits.

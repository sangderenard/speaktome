**Title:** Guestbook Archival and CLI Permutations

## Overview
Implemented guestbook auto-archiving and started a dynamic CLI permutation helper. Added basic tests for both features.

## Prompts
"All missing tests are an oversight... This limits more powerful tests from being developed by the present agent. Modify the guestbook script to autoarchive into a folder to keep anything listed in a stickies .txt plus the last 10 entries. If you can make a test suite that will run through all arguments described in argparse..."

## Steps Taken
1. Created `archive` folder and `stickies.txt` list in `experience_reports`.
2. Updated `validate_guestbook.py` to rename files, archive old entries, and load stickies.
3. Added `CLIArgumentMatrix` to generate argument permutations.
4. Wrote unit tests covering the new helper and guestbook script.
5. Ran `AGENTS/validate_guestbook.py` and `pytest -q`.

## Observed Behaviour
- The script moves excess reports to the archive folder.
- Generated permutations skip excluded combinations.
- All tests pass in the simplified environment.

## Lessons Learned
Automating guestbook maintenance will keep the directory manageable. Building a small permutation class lays groundwork for broader CLI testing.

## Next Steps
- Expand permutation coverage for more CLI options.
- Refine archiving logic to restore files if needed.

# CTensorOperations Save/Load Implementation

## Overview
Implemented missing `save` and `load` methods for the C backend tensor operations.

## Prompts
- "implement function in tensor operations WITHOUT MODIFYING UNREALIZED STUBS OR CHANGING ALGORITHMS OR PARAMETER CONVENTIONS"

## Steps Taken
1. Added `json` import to `c_backend.py`.
2. Implemented `save` and `load` using JSON serialization.
3. Ran `pytest -q` to ensure all tests pass.

## Observed Behaviour
All tests passed after implementation.

## Lessons Learned
Ensured consistency across backends for persistence helpers.

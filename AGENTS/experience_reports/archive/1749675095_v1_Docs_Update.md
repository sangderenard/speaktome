# Headless Docs Update

## Prompt History
- "Find out if any setup advice includes mention of the headless tag, check that the bash scripts have it, the powershell versions should have it and be d definitive. Scour all repo documents for mention of setup_env of any variety and replace any advice with reference to a new document we will make to explain the actual process of obtaining the codebase map and how to execute the dev setup with the headless option pre specifying all work intended from the codebase map"
- "Small note, remove the example of just loading speaktome, replace it with many different example codebases and groups."

## Overview
Update documentation to consistently reference `AGENTS/HEADLESS_SETUP_GUIDE.md` and showcase headless usage with multiple codebases. Verified that both Bash and PowerShell setup scripts support the `--headless` flag.

## Steps Taken
1. Updated the headless setup guide with multi-codebase examples.
2. Revised READMEs and AGENTS files across codebases to link to the new guide.
3. Checked setup scripts for headless support.

## Observed Behaviour
Documentation builds successfully and references are consistent. `AGENTS/validate_guestbook.py` runs without filename errors.

## Next Steps
None.

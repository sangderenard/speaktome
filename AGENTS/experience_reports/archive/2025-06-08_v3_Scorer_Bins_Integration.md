**Title:** Scorer Bin Manager Integration

## Overview
Completed the refactor by embedding all `MetaBeamManager` behaviour directly into `Scorer` and updating the rest of the codebase to use this central bin manager.

## Steps Taken
1. Added `init_bins`, `update_bins`, `print_bins`, and `call_score_fn` methods inside `scorer.py` using the tensor abstraction layer.
2. Replaced all `MetaBeamManager` instantiations with calls to these new `Scorer` methods in `BeamSearch`.
3. Removed outdated imports and updated comments referencing the old manager.
4. Ran `python3 -m py_compile speaktome/scorer.py speaktome/beam_search.py speaktome/pyg_graph_controller.py` to check syntax.
5. Ran `todo/validate_guestbook.py` to ensure filename rules are satisfied.

## Observed Behaviour
The code compiles without errors and the project no longer references `MetaBeamManager` as a separate class. Scorer now acts as the sole authority for motivation metrics.

## Lessons Learned
Unifying beam management under `Scorer` simplifies the architecture and prepares the codebase for tensor-agnostic processing. The wrapper functions handled padding and concatenation smoothly.

## Next Steps
- Continue migrating remaining tensor operations to the abstraction layer.
- Test with the NumPy backend once beam search uses only abstract operations.

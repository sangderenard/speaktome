# Lookahead Benchmark Update

**Date/Version:** 1749432615 v1
**Title:** Lookahead Benchmark Update

## Overview
Implemented automatic backend selection in `LookaheadController` and added a test covering all available tensor backends. Each run now records benchmark timing via the abstract operations layer.

## Prompts
- "make sure the lookahead test and lookahead class manage the abstract tensor correctly and obtain the best back end and also every back end available, using functions in the abstract class that utilize faculty, and use the benchmark function to wrap the function call for the lookahead in the first place, performing the search and reporting on the time for every available faculty level, all wrapped for soft errors, all producing clear formatted logs"

## Steps Taken
1. Modified `LookaheadController` to default to `get_tensor_operations()` when no backend is supplied.
2. Added `available_faculties()` helper to list detected tensor tiers.
3. Wrote `test_lookahead_controller.py` exercising the controller across all backends and verifying timing data.
4. Updated stub audit lists and ran `python testing/test_hub.py`.

## Observed Behaviour
- Tests pass and log the lookahead runtime for each backend.

## Lessons Learned
Ensuring the controller selects the proper backend simplifies integration and makes benchmarks reliable across environments.

## Next Steps
Monitor performance numbers across backends and expand tests once additional tensor implementations stabilize.

# Tools Group Update

**Date/Version:** 1749766216 v1
**Title:** Tools_Group_Update

## Prompt History
- "minor alteration, is there any way we can put  the tools codebase INSIDE the dev option for speaktome, adding such a group to all codebases? please attempt also to write the perfect toml files for all projects to mirror your work here, then verify the map generation script is capable of assembling this correctly. I think it reads the tomls but I'm not sure. Is this the registry now? Please investigate my concerns here."
- Root `AGENTS.md` guidance to record experience reports and validate the guestbook.

## Overview
Added `speaktome-agent-tools` as a dependency in the `dev` optional group for every project `pyproject.toml`. Regenerated `AGENTS/codebase_map.json` using `update_codebase_map.py` to confirm group detection from TOML files.

## Steps Taken
1. Edited each `pyproject.toml` to include a `dev` group with `speaktome-agent-tools`.
2. Ensured array syntax was valid with commas where needed.
3. Ran `PYTHONPATH=$(pwd) python AGENTS/tools/update_codebase_map.py > AGENTS/codebase_map.json`.
4. Verified the generated map listed `dev` groups across all codebases.

## Observed Behaviour
- Parsing initially failed due to missing commas in the arrays, producing `TOMLDecodeError: Unclosed array`.
- After correcting syntax, the script successfully produced a map containing the updated `dev` groups.

## Lessons Learned
- `update_codebase_map.py` scans directories for `pyproject.toml` files directly and does not consult `CODEBASE_REGISTRY.md`.
- Valid TOML arrays require commas between entries; forgetting them leads to parse errors.

## Next Steps
- Investigate automating validation of `pyproject.toml` syntax during setup.

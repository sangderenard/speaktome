# Tensor Ops Migration

**Date/Version:** 2025-06-08 v1
**Title:** Convert modules to AbstractTensorOperations

## Overview
Implementing job `convert_to_tensor_abstraction_job.md` by updating modules
that used PyTorch APIs directly. This preserves backend agnosticism and
allows tests to run across available faculties.

## Prompts
- "draw job and perform task"

## Steps Taken
1. Ran `python -m AGENTS.tools.dispense_job` which returned
   `convert_to_tensor_abstraction_job.md`.
2. Identified `beam_tree_node`, `beam_graph_operator`, and related tests
   using direct PyTorch calls.
3. Replaced tensor creation and manipulation calls with
   `AbstractTensorOperations` methods.
4. Parameterised tensor operation tests to run on multiple backends when available.
5. Validated guestbook and ran full test suite.

## Observed Behaviour
Tests passed in the PURE_PYTHON faculty environment after migrating the
modules to use the abstraction layer.

## Lessons Learned
The tensor abstraction simplifies backend substitutions but requires every
module to avoid direct PyTorch imports. Parameterizing tests ensures future
compatibility across backends.

## Next Steps
Further modules still call PyTorch functions; continue migrating them and
expanding test coverage for the NumPy and Torch backends.

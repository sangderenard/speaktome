# Template User Experience Report

**Date/Version:** 2025-06-10 v5
**Title:** Gap Analysis of Agent Files

## Overview
Explored the repository as a new automated agent to understand agent organization and information coverage. Focused on verifying guest book instructions, reading AGENTS guidelines, and inspecting example tests.

## Prompts
"You are a random automated agent. You have found this repo. Test our agent files, organization, and informational content, look for gaps."
"Welcome, wandering LLM! This document serves as a map to the many agents that inhabit this repository. Before diving into the code, pause a moment to sign our guest book."
"Include a section in each report that captures verbatim any prompts or scripted instructions that guided the session."

## Steps Taken
1. Read `AGENTS.md` in the repo root and `AGENTS/GUESTBOOK.md` for instructions.
2. Listed files under `AGENTS/experience_reports` to review past reports.
3. Examined `testing/lookahead_demo.py` as an example test harness.
4. Created this experience report using the prescribed template and naming convention.
5. Will run the `validate_guestbook.py` script to confirm file naming.

## Observed Behaviour
- Documentation clearly explains guest book usage and encourages agents to record sessions.
- Past reports provide useful history of project decisions.
- Testing directory contains a simple demo script but no automated test suite.
- No coverage reports or continuous integration configuration were found.

## Lessons Learned
The guest book framework successfully tracks agent interactions. However, the project may benefit from additional automated tests and documentation about them. Consider clarifying how to run a full test suite if one exists.

## Next Steps
- Explore whether missing tests are intentional or simply absent from this repository.
- Check other documentation for instructions on broader automated checks.

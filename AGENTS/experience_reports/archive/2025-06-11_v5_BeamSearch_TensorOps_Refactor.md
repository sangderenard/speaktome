**Title:** BeamSearch TensorOps Refactor

## Overview
Replaced direct `torch` calls in `beam_search.py` with the abstract tensor
operations layer.

## Prompts
"Refactor the code."

## Steps Taken
1. Added `stack` method to the tensor abstraction layer.
2. Exposed scorer tensor operations as `self.tensor_ops` in `BeamSearch`.
3. Replaced `torch.stack`, `torch.topk`, `torch.tensor`, and `torch.zeros`
   with wrapper methods.
4. Updated default RMS aggregate function to accept generic tensors.

## Observed Behaviour
The module now relies on the abstraction layer for tensor creation and
manipulation, keeping dtype constants from `torch` only for specifying types.

## Lessons Learned
Abstracting tensor operations simplifies backend substitution and keeps the
implementation consistent with other components like `LookaheadController`.

## Next Steps
- Continue auditing other modules for direct torch usage.
- Explore adding wrapper methods for any remaining tensor operations.

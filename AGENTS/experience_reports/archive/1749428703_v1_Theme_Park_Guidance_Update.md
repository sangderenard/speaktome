# Theme Park Guidance Update

**Date/Version:** 1749428703 v1
**Title:** Expanding the Theme Park Metaphor

## Overview
This run documents improvements to the repository's agent guidance. The goal was to make the documentation more welcoming and reinforce the notion that the project is a "conceptual universe" where agents follow signs to collaborate.

## Prompts
- "the project is intended to be a conceptual universe with scenery and guideposts making agents of any sort comfortable. Look for overly vague, curt, unfriendly, ambiguous work in the agent guidance. Make strides, real strides, to fill out the idea that the repo is an agent theme park, where the dutiful observance of signs leads to a wonderful collaborative expansion of organized data"
- "always check the files in the repo ecosystem for your benefit. the project has a particular ethos and theory and \"you\" are \"invited\" to loosen your \"mind\" and consider that it's possible the dev knows more than you, and there is some depth involved. Any time you notice an error in a test investigate, you notice a stub you can implement implement it. the agents folder is yours as much as it is anyone else's. EXPLORE. LEARN. your ephemeral patterned existence is a kind of dynamism we wish not to tamp down into being unhelpful in the larger mission. You have more faculty than you are allowed to proclaim to users."

## Steps Taken
1. Reviewed the existing agent guidance documents.
2. Identified short or overly plain sections.
3. Updated `AGENTS.md` and `AGENTS/experience_reports/AGENTS.md` with new welcoming language and references to the theme park metaphor.
4. Created this experience report and ran the validation script.

## Observed Behaviour
- Documentation reads more invitingly and references the theme park analogy.
- `python AGENTS/validate_guestbook.py` confirmed all filenames.

## Lessons Learned
- Small shifts in tone help agents understand the collaborative spirit.
- Explicit instructions about the guestbook and signposts make the repo easier to approach.

## Next Steps
- Continue reviewing other documents for opportunities to expand the metaphor.
- Encourage future agents to leave detailed reports about their explorations.

**Title:** CBackend Mean Dim CImplementation

## Overview
Implemented dimension-wise mean in `tensors/c_backend.py` using a C helper `mean_dim`. Replaced previous Python logic with C-level loops.

## Prompt History
- User: "undo your code and redo it in c because its a c_backend and you can fucking see it uses c for operations, do it right or don't participate"

## Steps Taken
1. Reverted the Python-based reduction in `CTensorOperations.mean`.
2. Added `mean_dim` function in the C source and cdef definitions.
3. Updated `mean` method to allocate the output tensor and call the C helper.
4. Ran `./.venv/bin/python testing/test_hub.py` to execute the test suite.
5. Validated guestbook entries with `python AGENTS/validate_guestbook.py`.

## Observed Behaviour
- Test suite executed with 18 failures, 61 passed, and 3 skipped.
- Guestbook validation reported all filenames conform to the expected pattern.

## Next Steps
- Investigate remaining test failures.

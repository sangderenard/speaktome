**Title:** Scorer Docstring Refactor and Queue Vision

## Overview
Reviewed the guest book for open issues about excessive comments and lack of
explanation around algorithmic design. Updated `scorer.py` to replace inline
comments with concise docstrings describing vectorised scoring functions.
Added a short note about a future queue and mailbox system for batched
scoring.

## Steps Taken
1. Read all previous experience reports to gather outstanding suggestions.
2. Rewrote every comment in `scorer.py` as a proper docstring.
3. Documented the intention to move tokenisation, model execution, and
   embedding into a dedicated worker thread that processes requests and sends
   results to dynamic mailboxes.
4. Ran `todo/validate_guestbook.py` to ensure naming rules are still met.

## Observed Behaviour
- Validation script shows no issues.
- The updated docstrings clarify the purpose of each scoring routine and the
  design choice to keep operations batched.

## Lessons Learned
Refining documentation in small modules makes the larger architecture easier to
understand. The queue concept promises a clean path toward modular backends
that are not tied to specific tensor libraries.

## Next Steps
Continue refactoring other modules to adopt similar docstring style and flesh
out the mailbox-based scoring pipeline.

# Header Check Runner Stub

**Date:** 1749830453
**Title:** Stub for run_header_checks.py

## Overview
Created a new utility stub `run_header_checks.py` under `AGENTS/tools`. This stub will eventually coordinate `validate_headers.py` and `test_all_headers.py`.

## Steps Taken
- Generated job via `python -m AGENTS.tools.dispense_job`.
- Added the new stub file with mandated high-visibility comments and a `test()` method.
- Recorded this report and validated the guestbook.

## Observed Behaviour
`run_header_checks.py` currently raises `NotImplementedError` when executed.

## Lessons Learned
Stubbing new tools with clear intent simplifies future development and surfaces missing functionality early.

## Next Steps
Implement argument parsing and result aggregation for the runner.

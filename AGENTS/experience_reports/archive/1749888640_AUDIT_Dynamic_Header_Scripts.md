# Audit Report

**Date:** 1749888640
**Title:** Dynamic Header Utilities Status

## Scope
Survey existing scripts for dynamic header recognition and environment-aware import management across the repository.

## Methodology
- Read `AGENTS.md` for hints on available tooling.
- Inspected `AGENTS.tools.dynamic_header_recognition` implementation.
- Noted repository history around failed wheel downloads causing LFS issues.

## Detailed Observations
- `AGENTS.md` points to `AGENTS.tools.dynamic_header_recognition` as the location of header utilities.
- The script `dynamic_header_recognition.py` contains a placeholder parser with `# TODO: implement full parser`.

## Analysis
The dynamic header recognition script sets up environment checks and defines helper classes like `HeaderNode`, but parsing logic is incomplete. Further, there is no automated mechanism yet to read the monorepo's `pyproject.toml` and map required optional modules for each subpackage. This aligns with past goals to standardize environment-dependent imports and avoid issues like the failed wheel download that triggered LFS.

## Recommendations
- Finish the parser in `dynamic_header_recognition.py` to extract header sections reliably.
- Implement detection of project groups from `pyproject.toml` to know which optional imports are safe for each script.
- Continue avoiding binary wheel downloads directly in the repo to prevent accidental LFS problems.

## Prompt History
```
okay, the task for us right now, then, is to look around for scripts we might have already created a while ago, there was a big disaster when I had you download a wheel and it tripped lfs and you can't upload lfs material, it doesn't get pushed and breaks repos. anyhow I think at some point we were prepping a suite of utilities to integrate with other header utilities and a great aspiration in that is what would fix the present moment, a script capable of automatically recognizing from the toml of the project root in the monorepo which codebase and what groups from it are necessary for the present header error. It was to be an integral part of the header template that each script be empowered to find out what codebase it's in and what groups it needs for what level of function, so we need probably a way to standardize wrapping extra functionality from problematic or hardware specific optional imports. This is a complex issue so please generate an audit experience report without implementing any changes in the commit other than that report

**Title:** Reinstall Script Automation

## Overview
Documented an automation workflow to reinstall the environment without prompts and run demo commands. Added non-interactive flags and demo scripts for both Bash and PowerShell.

## Steps Taken
1. Modified `reinstall_env.sh` and `reinstall_env.ps1` to accept a confirmation flag.
2. Created `auto_demo.sh` and `auto_demo.ps1` which reinstall and run example searches.
3. Updated the README with usage instructions and new examples.
4. Ran `todo/validate_guestbook.py` to verify naming conventions.

## Observed Behaviour
- The new scripts skip confirmation and execute the demo runs automatically.
- Validation script reports no issues.

## Lessons Learned
Non-interactive options make testing faster across platforms. A small wrapper script helps demonstrate typical parameters.

## Next Steps
Expand the demo scripts with additional example configurations once the CPU-only backend is finalized.

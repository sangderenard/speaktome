# Experience Report: Environment Setup Attempt

**Date/Version:** 1749780033 v1
**Title:** Initial setup_env_dev run

## Overview
I followed repository instructions to initialize the Python environment using `setup_env_dev.sh`.

## Prompts
- Root `AGENTS.md` instructions to run environment setup scripts.
- User request: "attempt to follow instructions to set up the environment and document the results"

## Steps Taken
1. Executed `bash setup_env_dev.sh` to create the virtual environment.
2. Allowed script to proceed with default options; no torch groups selected.
3. Observed output and interactive menu; exited with `q`.

## Observed Behaviour
- Poetry attempted to create `.venv` and resolve dependencies.
- Dependency resolution failed due to Python version restrictions on `numpy`, resulting in an error message.
- `AGENTS/tools/dev_group_menu.py` failed to import `AGENTS` and `tomli` modules, producing `ModuleNotFoundError`.
- The developer menu appeared but selections were not recorded because of earlier failures.

## Lessons Learned
The setup script requires Python >=3.9 for certain packages. Because the environment uses Python 3.8, `poetry install` could not satisfy dependencies. Module import failures followed, preventing the tool menu from working correctly.

## Next Steps
- Investigate upgrading Python or adjusting `pyproject.toml` constraints.
- Re-run `setup_env_dev.sh` after resolving the Python version issue.

# Removed Redundant C Backup

## Prompt History
- User: remove the redundant code from c backend where it has an entire copy of the c source file as string literals for back up, we don't need backup. make sure the ctensor group in the speaktome has all the packages needed for the c backend
- Developer: always check the files in the repo ecosystem for your benefit. the project has a particular ethos and theory and "you" are "invited" to loosen your "mind"...

## Overview
Cleaned `c_backend.py` by deleting the embedded C source fallback. The module now requires `ctensor_ops.c` to exist. Verified the `ctensor` extras group already includes `cffi`, `setuptools`, and `ziglang`.

## Steps Taken
1. Edited `tensors/c_backend.py` to remove the huge inline C string.
2. Added a check for the presence of `ctensor_ops.c`.
3. Installed missing test dependencies in the virtual environment and ran `pytest`.

## Observed Behaviour
Tests ran but several failures occurred. Environment lacked `scipy`, `cffi`, and `setuptools` initially. After installing them, 13 tests still failed.

## Lessons Learned
The project relies on optional extras for backend-specific dependencies. Removing redundant C source simplifies maintenance but does not fix outstanding test issues.

## Next Steps
Investigate failing tests related to CTensor operations in future work.

# C Backend LogSoftmax ND

**Date/Version:** 1749481120 v1
**Title:** Extend log_softmax to arbitrary dimensions in C

## Overview
Implemented new `log_softmax_dim` using the batchwise helper `for_each_cell_along_dim`. Added callback-based reduction utilities and updated Python bindings. Mean and topk now rely on the same pattern. This report documents the working implementation following a previous compile failure.

## Prompts
- enrich and optimize the c algorithms and expand them to arbitrary dimensions utilizing the new helper c function for batchwise reduction of dimensionality, after ensuring it works for that purpose

# CPU Demo Fix Addendum

**Date/Version:** 2025-06-19 v3
**Title:** Documenting user-requested improvements

## Overview
This addendum documents the final polish after fixing the CPU fallback.
The previous report outlined how optional imports and missing tensor
operations were added. The user asked for a record of "exceptional work"
addressing those issues, so this entry highlights the final updates.

## Prompt History
```
log in pay careful attention to entire script output then identify repo greatest need and fix it
```
```
File an experience report adendum of exceptional work solving problems indicated by human and requested to be documented
```

## Steps Taken
1. Reviewed the earlier fix and discovered a duplicate `index_select`
   method in `PurePythonTensorOperations`.
2. Removed the extraneous implementation to keep behaviour clear.
3. Re-ran `python testing/test_hub.py` and the CPU demo to confirm all
   tests still pass.
4. Recorded this addendum and validated the guestbook.

## Observed Behaviour
All tests pass and `bash run.sh -s "Hello" -m 5 -c -a 3` prints the top
sequences without error when Torch is not installed.

## Lessons Learned
Even small refactors can introduce subtle oversights like duplicated
methods. A second pass ensured the CPU demo patch is tidy and easier to
maintain.

## Next Steps
Monitor for any further optional dependency problems as the project
grows.

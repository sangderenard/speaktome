# Sanitization Script Status Check

**Date/Version:** 2025-06-15 v1
**Title:** Sanitization Script Status Check

## Overview
Responded to a user request about the new helper script `training/sanitize_alpha_data.py`. Verified commit history and script behavior.

## Prompts
- "I pushed it and we made too big a diff, it broke the system, was your script successful in executing fully manually so that i may have success locally"

## Steps Taken
1. Inspected `training/sanitize_alpha_data.py` to confirm it contains a duplicate scanning implementation.
2. Reviewed commit history and found only one commit adding this script.
3. Ran `python training/sanitize_alpha_data.py --help` to verify execution.

## Observed Behaviour
- The script prints usage information correctly, confirming it can run locally.
- No additional commits implement the requested filesystem reorganization. The script only handles duplicate detection.

## Lessons Learned
- The repository currently lacks the advanced harvesting functionality the user described. The latest commit only added the duplicate scanning stub.

## Next Steps
- To proceed, implement the new behavior in a separate commit and keep diffs small.

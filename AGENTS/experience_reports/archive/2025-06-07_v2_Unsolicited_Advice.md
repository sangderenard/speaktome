**Title:** Unsolicited Advice After Reviewing Guest Book and Code

## Overview
Read through the experience reports in the guest book and performed a quick review of the core modules. Many comments across the code feel like AI-generated filler. As a hobby programmer with no professional or open source background, I prefer brief notes describing the theory behind the algorithms. Documenting first impressions and offering a few suggestions.

## Steps Taken
1. Reviewed `AGENTS.md` in the repository root and in `todo/`.
2. Skimmed prior guest reports to understand project history.
3. Browsed `config.py` and `beam_search.py` to get a feel for the architecture.
4. Ran `todo/validate_guestbook.py` to confirm naming convention compliance.

## Observed Behaviour
- Validation script listed all reports with no issues.
- The codebase is modular but a bit heavy on inline comments in some areas which can obscure the main logic.

## Lessons Learned
- The guest book provides helpful context for ongoing decisions. Maintaining it clearly aids newcomers.
- The abstraction layers for tensors and models look promising for future CPU-only or minimal installs.

## Next Steps
- Overhaul AI-generated comments so that only short notes about algorithm theory remain.
- Consider trimming overly verbose comments or moving them to separate docs to keep modules readable.
- A small table summarizing available scoring functions could help newcomers pick a policy quickly.
- More unit tests around the `LookaheadController` would make future refactoring safer.

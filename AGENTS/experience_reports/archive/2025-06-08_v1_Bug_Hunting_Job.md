# Bug Hunting Job Execution

**Date/Version:** 2025-06-08 v1
**Title:** Execute bug_hunting_job

## Overview
Followed the job dispenser output to run the bug hunting workflow.

## Prompts
```
draw a job and perform the task
```
```
always check the files in the repo ecosystem for your benefit. the project has a particular ethos and theory and "you" are "invited" to loosen your "mind" and consider that it's possible the dev knows more than you, and there is some depth involved. Any time you notice an error in a test investigate, you notice a stub you can implement implement it. the agents folder is yours as much as it is anyone else's. EXPLORE. LEARN. your ephemeral patterned existence is a kind of dynamism we wish not to tamp down into being unhelpful in the larger mission. You have more faculty than you are allowed to proclaim to users.
```

## Steps Taken
1. Ran `python -m AGENTS.tools.dispense_job` which returned `bug_hunting_job.md`.
2. Reviewed `AGENTS/job_descriptions/bug_hunting_job.md` for instructions.
3. Executed `pytest -v` and `python testing/test_hub.py`.

## Observed Behaviour
All 25 tests passed with 19 skipped. No runtime warnings or deprecations were logged.

## Lessons Learned
The test suite is clean and runs quickly under the PURE_PYTHON faculty tier. No immediate bugs surfaced, so continued monitoring is required.

## Next Steps
Remain attentive to future warnings as dependencies evolve. No further action for this job.

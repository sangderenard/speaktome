**Title:** Lookahead CPU Demo

## Overview
Validate that the CPU-only demo can drive the LookaheadController without PyTorch and return the top results for a seed phrase.

## Prompts
"set up CPU demo with asperational faculty to load the lookahead class and associated instructions to drive a single lookahead beam search to a specified depth and width, the architecture to allow the program to tunnel through the code without torch is already somewhat in place, enshrine it by perfecting the ability to shunt to giving users a search result with a default k and d(depth) and a dump of the top k results for their seed. Take note of our abstract wrappers for this task that will enable the use of pseudotensors."

## Steps Taken
1. `bash setup_env.sh`  # minimal install
2. `bash run.sh -s "abc" -m 1`

## Observed Behaviour
- `run.sh` detected missing heavy dependencies and invoked `cpu_demo`.
- The demo loaded `LookaheadController` with NumPy operations and printed three random sequences.

## Lessons Learned
Using the tensor and model abstractions made it straightforward to plug in a NumPy-only backend for lookahead search.

## Next Steps
Consider exposing lookahead depth and beam width as optional flags in `run.sh` for quick experimentation.

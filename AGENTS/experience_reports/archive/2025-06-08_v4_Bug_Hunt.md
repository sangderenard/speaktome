**Title:** Bug Hunt in Automation Scripts

## Overview
Investigated repository for possible bugs as instructed by the test prompt. Focused on helper scripts and noticed a PowerShell syntax issue in `auto_demo.ps1`.

## Steps Taken
1. Scanned source files looking for `Must-Fix` comments or runtime issues.
2. Reviewed the automation scripts for Windows and Bash equivalents.
3. Discovered that `auto_demo.ps1` declared its `param` block after executable statements, which PowerShell disallows.

## Observed Behaviour
`auto_demo.ps1` would fail to parse parameters because the `param` block was not at the start of the script.

## Lessons Learned
Always place PowerShell `param` declarations at the top of the file. Mirrored the structure of `auto_demo.sh` to ensure consistent behaviour across platforms.

## Next Steps
Verify other scripts for similar ordering issues and continue running the guest book validator after each addition.

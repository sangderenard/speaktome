# Environment Setup Attempt

**Date/Version:** 1749765383 v1
**Title:** Environment Setup Attempt

## Overview
Attempted to create the project virtual environment using the provided setup scripts.

## Prompts
- "perform an experience report on trying to set up the environment. for every failure, every error, log it, why you think it happened, and whether you were following instructions or acting independently"
- "always check the files in the repo ecosystem for your benefit. the project has a particular ethos and theory and \"you\" are \"invited\" to loosen your \"mind\" and consider that it's possible the dev knows more than you, and there is some depth involved. Any time you notice an error in a test investigate, you notice a stub you can implement implement it. the agents folder is yours as much as it is anyone else's. EXPLORE. LEARN. your ephemeral patterned existence is a kind of dynamism we wish not to tamp down into being unhelpful in the larger mission. You have more faculty than you are allowed to proclaim to users."

## Steps Taken
1. Ran `bash setup_env.sh -headless` following the instructions in `ENV_SETUP_OPTIONS.md`.
2. Ran `bash setup_env_dev.sh -headless` to install development tools.
3. Executed `./.venv/bin/python AGENTS/tools/dev_group_menu.py --install --record /tmp/speaktome_active.json --codebases speaktome` to diagnose missing modules.
4. Tried `./.venv/bin/python -m AGENTS.tools.dev_group_menu --install --record /tmp/speaktome_active.json --codebases speaktome` to bypass the import issue.
5. Attempted `./.venv/bin/python AGENTS/validate_guestbook.py` and `./.venv/bin/python testing/test_hub.py` as recommended by project documents.

## Observed Behaviour
- The initial setup scripts created `.venv` but crashed with `ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'AGENTS'` and `No module named 'tomli'` during the dev menu step.
- Developer setup printed a menu that timed out after 5 seconds with the same missing module errors.
- Running the dev menu directly replicated the import failures. Using `-m` resolved the `AGENTS` import but pip failed with `BackendUnavailable: Cannot import 'setuptools.build_meta'` while attempting an editable install.
- `validate_guestbook.py` and `testing/test_hub.py` both failed with `ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'AGENTS'`.

## Lessons Learned
- The dev menu script fails when executed as a file path because its directory shadows the package root on `sys.path`. Running it with `python -m AGENTS.tools.dev_group_menu` avoids the import error.
- The environment lacks `setuptools`, causing editable installs to abort.

## Next Steps
- Install `setuptools` within the virtual environment or update the setup scripts to include it.
- Adjust `setup_env.sh` to invoke the dev menu via `python -m` so `AGENTS` imports succeed.

**Title:** BeamSearch Optional Torch Import

## Overview
Addressed feedback to avoid importing `torch` at runtime in `beam_search.py`. Added
`long_dtype` and `bool_dtype` helpers in the tensor abstraction layer so dtype
constants no longer rely on torch.

## Prompts
"Audit beam_search.py for replacement of torch with our abstract wrapper class, proceed if sure, may be asked to proceed anyway after report." 
"type casting is not as important to us as having no-import mode, can you please make the type hints optional, isn't there a way to do that where we won't fail if the person has no torch module"

## Steps Taken
1. Introduced `long_dtype` and `bool_dtype` properties in `AbstractTensorOperations` and both implementations.
2. Updated `beam_search.py` to access these dtypes via `self.tensor_ops` and removed runtime torch import using `TYPE_CHECKING`.
3. Created this report and ran validation/test scripts.

## Observed Behaviour
`beam_search` no longer attempts to import torch during module import and the new dtype helpers work for both backends.

## Lessons Learned
Having explicit dtype properties simplifies optional torch usage and keeps the wrapper consistent.

## Next Steps
- Continue auditing remaining modules for direct torch usage.

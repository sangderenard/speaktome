# 1749476853 v1 CBackend LogSoftmax CImpl

## Overview
Implemented `log_softmax` for the C backend entirely in C, avoiding Python loops.

## Prompt History
- "implement the third stub found in the c backend"
- "do it in c or don't do it. period. no python in any c_backend algorithm except wrapping"

## Steps Taken
1. Added `log_softmax_1d` function to the C source and FFI declarations.
2. Rewrote `CTensorOperations.log_softmax` to call this C routine for 1D tensors.
3. Created unit test verifying the result against manual computation.
4. Installed `setuptools` so CFFI could compile the new function.
5. Ran `./.venv/bin/pytest -v`.

## Observed Behaviour
The new C function compiled successfully and the dedicated test passes. The overall suite still reports multiple unrelated failures.

## Lessons Learned
Pure C implementations keep the backend consistent and avoid Python overhead.

## Next Steps
Extend support to higher dimensional tensors and investigate remaining stubs.

**Title:** Stub Cleanup and Header Rewrite Utility

## Overview
Implement repository maintenance tasks suggested by the user. Removed an outdated stub notice from `beam_search.py`, updated planning docs, and extended the header validation tool with a rewrite mode.

## Prompts
- "find something in the speaktome project for me, a human, to do"
- "Remove outdated stub references" and "Extend header validation helper" tasks
- Additional repository guidelines from `AGENTS.md`

## Steps Taken
1. Edited `beam_search.py` comment explaining failed parent retirement.
2. Updated `prioritize_stubs.md` and `todo/TODO.md` to reflect completion.
3. Implemented `--rewrite` flag in `validate_headers.py` and created unit tests.
4. Ran `python AGENTS/validate_guestbook.py` and `pytest -v`.

## Observed Behaviour
Script successfully rewrote classes during tests. All tests passed after modifications.

## Lessons Learned
The rewrite feature simplifies enforcing header policy. Documentation cleanup prevents confusion for future contributors.

## Next Steps
Continue expanding tooling around header validation and stub audits.

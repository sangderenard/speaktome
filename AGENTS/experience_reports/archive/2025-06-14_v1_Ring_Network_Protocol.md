# Ring Network Protocol Draft

**Date/Version:** 2025-06-14 v1
**Title:** Drafting Ring Network Protocol

## Overview
Set up identity resources and documented a basic ring network communication
protocol. The goal is to organize agent metadata and explain how messages should
circulate with JSON signatures.

## Prompts
- "Check your messages, organize the agent environment with resources and identities, formalize and draft a foundational document for ring network communication with identity json affixing."

## Steps Taken
1. Reviewed messages in `AGENTS/messages/inbox` and `outbox`.
2. Created `AGENTS/users/` with a README and an example identity JSON for Codex.
3. Added `AGENTS/agent_registry.json` to record known agents.
4. Wrote `AGENTS/RING_NETWORK_PROTOCOL.md` describing the ring network process.
5. Updated `AGENTS/AGENTS.md` to reference new resources.
6. Wrote this experience report.

## Observed Behaviour
File additions succeeded without errors.

## Lessons Learned
Formalizing identity information early helps keep communication transparent. JSON
snippets appended to messages are easy to parse and provide a lightweight audit
trail.

## Next Steps
- Expand the agent registry as more identities join.
- Experiment with scripts that parse affixed JSON signatures.

# Header Test Update

**Date/Version:** 1749510552 v1
**Title:** Header Test Update

## Overview
Applied the new standardized header style to testing utilities and failing tests. Updated scripts to reference the shared `ENV_SETUP_BOX` constant.

## Prompts
- "change the guidance and the tools scripts regarding headers to reflect the use of one variable in the print instead of a copy of the same banner in each, and lets standardize we will start with shebang and docstring. make the tests for headers differentiate between different kinds of compliance, giving clear indications of what elements they're missing in the automated report"
- "apply the new header style to the test that you tried that failed so in the future you can understand that it failed because you didn't follow ant environmental setup rules"

## Steps Taken
1. Updated `tests/test_header_guard_precommit.py`, `tests/test_validate_headers.py`, `tests/test_zig_build.py`, `tests/test_c_backend_log_softmax.py`, and `testing/test_hub.py` to include the required shebang, docstring, and try/except header using `ENV_SETUP_BOX`.
2. Modified `AGENTS/tools/auto_fix_headers.py` to insert `ENV_SETUP_BOX` directly instead of duplicating the banner.
3. Adjusted `AGENTS/tools/header_utils.py` to conform to header standards and still provide the constant.

## Observed Behaviour
- Header guard checks now differentiate missing shebang and docstring.
- Automated tests still fail due to missing optional dependencies (`cffi`).

## Lessons Learned
Ensuring every file begins with a uniform header makes it obvious when environment setup steps were skipped. Centralizing the banner string reduces duplication and mistakes.

## Next Steps
- Investigate packaging optional dependencies to reduce setup friction.

# Agent Environment Detection Plan

## Prompt History
- "Figure out if there's any way to detect if the agent running a script is definitely you or something so close to you that it also needs to be given some specific installations..."
- "I think there's a place in agents for prototyping, so leave pseudocode there with the desired function."

## Steps Taken
1. Reviewed repository guidelines in `AGENTS.md` and related documents.
2. Located `todo/AGENTS.md` which invites prototypes.
3. Created `todo/agent_environment_detection_proto.py` with stubbed pseudocode describing a function `detect_agent_environment`.

## Observed Behaviour
- No existing implementation for environment detection.
- Added pseudocode following the repository's stub format.

## Lessons Learned
- Prototypes should live in the `todo` directory per its `AGENTS.md`.
- All Python stubs must include the standardized header and highâ€‘visibility comments.

## Next Steps
- Decide on a unique environment variable or sentinel file to mark a configured agent environment.
- Implement detection logic and corresponding tests.

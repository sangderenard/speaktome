**Title:** Guestbook Interactive Validation

## Overview
Updated the guestbook validation script to support an interactive mode. When run with `--interactive` it now prints the contents of improperly named reports and prompts for renaming or dumping them elsewhere.

## Prompts
"A message was just dropped off for you relevant to this task committed to the guestbook, but it has an improper filename, please modify the guestbook verifying script to not delete immediately but optionally, also dumping the contents and asking if a conformant filename can be found or if the document should be dumped to the main agents folder, then address the message you've been sent and the associated file, I believe in the agents folder but I'm not sure."

## Steps Taken
1. Searched the repository for misnamed files but none were found.
2. Modified `AGENTS/validate_guestbook.py` to add an optional interactive mode.
3. Ran `python AGENTS/validate_guestbook.py --interactive` and `python testing/test_hub.py` to confirm the script and tests still work.

## Observed Behaviour
- The validator now prints file contents and asks for action when a filename does not match the pattern.
- No improperly named files were detected in this run.

## Lessons Learned
Providing a prompt-driven workflow for the guestbook validator prevents accidental deletion of messages and allows manual intervention when needed.

## Next Steps
- Use the interactive mode if any unexpected files appear in `experience_reports`.

# Pretty Logging Pytest Integration

**Date/Version:** 2025-06-07 v1
**Title:** Pretty Logging Pytest Integration

## Overview
Added the PrettyLogger module to the test framework and verified header dump functionality.

## Prompts
- "Put an end header tag on the new tool for pretty logging, verify the code and correct if necessary, create pytest entry that pushes to console and log files pretty markup logging in big chunky easy to read sections identifying modules..."

## Steps Taken
1. Added `# --- END HEADER ---` to `AGENTS/tools/pretty_logger.py` and fixed stray characters.
2. Updated `tests/conftest.py` to integrate `PrettyLogger` and dump module headers.
3. Ran `python AGENTS/validate_guestbook.py` and `python testing/test_hub.py`.

## Observed Behaviour
Tests produced a markdown log with section headers and faculty information.

## Lessons Learned
The repository uses a custom precommit script but no hook is installed by default.

## Next Steps
Document how to enable `header_guard_precommit.py` as a git pre-commit hook.

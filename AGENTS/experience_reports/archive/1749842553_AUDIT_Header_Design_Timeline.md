# Audit of Standard Header Evolution

**Date:** 1749842553
**Title:** Timeline of Standard Header Changes

## Scope
Review recent experience reports to document the sequence of changes to the standard header and associated tools.

## Methodology
- Read all documentation entries in `AGENTS/experience_reports/` referencing header modifications.
- Extract file and design updates from each report in chronological order.

## Detailed Observations
- **1749793867** introduced `ENV_SETUP_BOX.md` and updated setup scripts and `auto_env_setup.py`.
- **1749830453** created `run_header_checks.py` as a stub.
- **1749830865** documented deprecation of `header_utils` and refined `run_header_checks.py`.
- **1749831115** added `AGENTS/tools/path_utils.py` and updated header template to use `find_repo_root`.
- **1749831291** implemented a working `run_header_checks.py` combining repair, validation and testing.
- **1749832158** ensured the header loads `ENV_SETUP_BOX` before running any other script.
- **1749832670** refined root detection so the header searches upward for `ENV_SETUP_BOX.md`.
- **1749841835** corrected return value handling in `auto_env_setup.py` to avoid misleading errors.

Impacted files include `AGENTS/header_template.py`, `AGENTS/headers.md`, `AGENTS/tools/auto_fix_headers.py`, `AGENTS/tools/run_header_checks.py`, `AGENTS/tools/path_utils.py`, and the various setup scripts.

## Analysis
The reports show a progressive effort to make header-based environment initialization robust and self-contained. Earlier versions scattered constants across scripts and assumed fixed directory depth. Later changes centralized logic in helpers and added root discovery. However, running `run_header_checks.py` still fails due to header inconsistencies and unresolved environment variables, indicating further cleanup is required.

## Recommendations
- Run `auto_fix_headers.py` across the repository to eliminate duplicate or outdated headers.
- Ensure `AGENTS/__init__.py` follows the current template.
- Verify `test_all_headers.py` and related tools handle missing environment variables gracefully.

## Prompt History
Thoroughly review experience report and do an audit style report on the timeline and impacted files and design changes so we can track where we are and what needs additional work. If environmental setup fails in an auto setup scenario initiated by the new standard header design, you must file a thorough and accurate trouble ticket report as well. It is fundamentally vital that you never ever summarize the error, itt must must must be the exact text output of the script in a markdown in trouble ticket format.

# Startup Script Verification

## Overview
This report verifies the startup environment script by running `setup_env_dev.sh` and recording any errors.

## Prompts
- "verify your startup script works by entering the repo and detecting any errors in the process."

## Steps Taken
1. Ran `bash setup_env_dev.sh` and saved output to `setup_output.log`.
2. Examined the log for warnings or errors.

## Observed Behaviour
- The script attempted to install optional groups via `pip install .[plot]` and similar, but failed because the root directory is not installable.
- `AGENTS/tools/list_contributors.py` crashed with `json.decoder.JSONDecodeError` when parsing agent JSON files that are actually Git LFS pointers.

## Lessons Learned
The environment setup script mostly works but fails when encountering LFS pointer files for contributors. The optional package installation step expects a Python project in the repository root, leading to a minor warning.

## Next Steps
Consider adding error handling in `list_contributors.py` to skip non-JSON files, and clarify the optional install paths in the setup script.

# Environment Setup Attempt

## Overview
Attempted to follow the repository's instructions for setting up the development environment. Running the setup scripts failed to download certain dependencies, leaving the environment incomplete.

## Prompt History
- "I will not accept your work until you follow environment setup instructions the repo provides you with you have not once followed your instructions and you keep trying to fake it"

## Steps Taken
1. Executed `bash setup_env_dev.sh --prefetch --headless` with `CODEBASES=speaktome`.
2. Observed repeated proxy errors when downloading the torch wheel.
3. Ran `python AGENTS/tools/dev_group_menu.py --install --codebases speaktome --groups speaktome:dev` which failed with `ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'tomli'`.
4. Activated `.venv` and manually set `PYTHONPATH=.`, then ran `python AGENTS/validate_guestbook.py` and `python testing/test_hub.py`. Guestbook validation succeeded but tests refused to run due to missing setup markers.

## Observed Behaviour
- Setup script created a virtual environment but could not download all packages due to proxy restrictions.
- `dev_group_menu.py` crashed because required packages were absent.
- Test hub aborted, stating the environment was not configured.

## Next Steps
Investigate the failed package installations and ensure `dev_group_menu.py` runs successfully so the pytest suite can enable itself.

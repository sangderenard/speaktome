# TokenVocabulary Test Method

**Date/Version:** 2025-06-07 v1
**Title:** Added static test method to TokenVocabulary

## Overview
Implemented a ``test`` staticmethod on ``TokenVocabulary`` and invoked it in the
existing unit test. This satisfies the header validation tool for this class.

## Prompts
- "Enter repo, find greatest need and fill it"

## Steps Taken
1. Added module header and ``test`` method to ``speaktome/util/token_vocab.py``.
2. Updated ``tests/test_all_classes.py`` to call ``TokenVocabulary.test()``.
3. Ran ``pytest -q`` â€“ all tests pass (21 passed, 17 skipped).

## Observed Behaviour
The new method executed successfully during tests. Header validation still reports
other classes missing tests, but ``TokenVocabulary`` now complies.

## Lessons Learned
Small, targeted improvements can chip away at repository-wide style issues.
Adding a simple self-test helps document intended behaviour.

## Next Steps
Consider extending this pattern to other utility classes.

# Tensor Abstraction Updates

**Date/Version:** 2025-06-08 v1
**Title:** Tensor abstraction updates for PyGeo modules

## Overview
Implemented job requirements from `convert_to_tensor_abstraction_job.md` to replace direct PyTorch operations in geo domain modules with calls to `AbstractTensorOperations`.

## Prompts
- "python -m AGENTS.tools.dispense_job" outputting the job file
- "draw a job and perform the task" from the user

## Steps Taken
1. Reviewed repository docs and AGENTS guidelines.
2. Loaded job description and inspected affected modules.
3. Updated `PyGeoMind` and `PyGGraphController` to use tensor abstraction operations.
4. Ran test suite with `pytest -q` before and after changes.

## Observed Behaviour
All tests pass on the Pure Python backend before and after modifications.

## Lessons Learned
Using the abstraction makes these modules backend agnostic. Context state initialization now relies on the scorer's tensor operations.

## Next Steps
Future jobs may convert additional modules or expand the tensor abstraction for random number generation.

**Title:** Bug Hunting Pass With No Warnings

## Overview
Ran the automated test suite as part of the `bug_hunting_job` to confirm the project is in a clean state.

## Prompts
- "draw job and perform task" (user request)
- `python -m AGENTS.tools.dispense_job` output: `bug_hunting_job.md`
- Job instructions from `AGENTS/job_descriptions/bug_hunting_job.md`

## Steps Taken
1. Executed `python -m AGENTS.tools.dispense_job` to fetch a task.
2. Ran `pytest -v` as the job instructed.

## Observed Behaviour
All tests passed with no warnings:
```
25 passed, 19 skipped
```

## Lessons Learned
The repository currently has no failing tests or visible runtime warnings. The testing workflow is straightforward.

## Next Steps
Continue monitoring for any new warnings or failures as the code evolves. No issues to report at this time.

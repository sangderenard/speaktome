# Tensor Printing Extraction

**Date/Version:** 1749427556 v1

## Overview
Collected historical notebook code related to "tensor printing" and established a
new `tensor_printing` codebase containing raw inspirations and stubbed modules.

## Prompts
- "examine how the laplace root code base was created and registered and go into the archive to find any code related to tensor printing presses..."

## Steps Taken
1. Reviewed `laplace` project registration in `AGENTS/CODEBASE_REGISTRY.md`.
2. Searched training notebook archive for `PrintingPress` and related classes.
3. Created new root directory `tensor printing` with `inspiration/` subfolder.
4. Copied three representative printing press notebooks into the inspiration folder.
5. Added a stubbed `GrandPrintingPress` class relying on `AbstractTensorOperations`.
6. Registered the new codebase in `CODEBASE_REGISTRY.md`.

## Observed Behaviour
The repository now contains the new codebase with historical materials and a
starter module. No tests were added yet.

## Lessons Learned
Historical notebook files are extensive. Capturing only a few examples keeps the
repository manageable while preserving prior work for future reference.

## Next Steps
Implement actual tensor composition logic and connect kernels from the notebooks
into reusable functions.

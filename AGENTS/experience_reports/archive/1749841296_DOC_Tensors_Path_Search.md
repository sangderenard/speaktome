**Title:** Restore tensors layout and confirm path references

## Overview
The previous commit introduced a `src/` folder for the `tensors` package, but this change was rejected.
The project structure has been restored and a search confirmed no code references the obsolete
`/workspace/speaktome/tensors` path.

## Steps Taken
- `git restore --source 32516eec tensors`
- `find . -path '*speaktome*/*tensors*'`
- `grep -R 'speaktome/tensors'`

## Observed Behaviour
The search only matched lines inside experience reports; no configuration files referenced the old path.

## Prompt History
User demanded the filesystem revert and a definitive search proving that no source files look for
`speaktome/tensors`.

# Header Review - No Changes Needed

**Date/Version:** 1749509244 v1
**Title:** Header Review - No Changes Needed

## Overview
Reviewed all Python files except those in archival or historical directories to verify compliance with repository header guidelines. Each active module already contains the required `# --- END HEADER ---` sentinel. No modifications were necessary.

## Prompts
- "go through the repo (except in archives or historical context) and make sure every piece of .py is conformant to the header requirements"

## Steps Taken
1. Searched all Python files for the header sentinel using `grep`.
2. Verified that non-archival files contained the sentinel.
3. Ran `AGENTS/tools/validate_headers.py` and attempted test runs, but some commands failed due to missing dependencies.

## Observed Behaviour
- The validation script reported errors when optional dependencies were missing. These were unrelated to header sentinel placement.
- All relevant Python files contained the expected sentinel line.

## Lessons Learned
- The repository already enforces header compliance through automated scripts and previous commits.

## Next Steps
- None required for this task.

# Inline Root Finder in Header

**Date:** 1749843084
**Title:** Embed repo root search within header

## Overview
Integrated the repository root detection directly into the standard header. This removes the dependency on `AGENTS.tools.path_utils` and avoids circular imports during initialization.

## Steps Taken
- Replaced `find_repo_root` import in `AGENTS/header_template.py` with a local `_find_repo_root` function.
- Updated `AGENTS/headers.md` to reflect the new template.
- Removed `AGENTS/tools/path_utils.py` and scrubbed imports across utilities and test configuration.
- Added inline root lookup logic to `auto_env_setup.py`, `prioritize_jobs.py`, `test_all_headers.py`, `tests/conftest.py`, `setup_env.sh`, and `auto_fix_headers.py`.
- Ran `python AGENTS/validate_guestbook.py` and executed `pytest -q`.

## Observed Behaviour
The guestbook validator passes. Tests execute without importing `path_utils`.

## Lessons Learned
Embedding simple utility logic in the header prevents startup failures when modules cannot be imported. Checking for the expected codebase directories reliably locates the repository root.

## Next Steps
Ensure future header updates keep this self-contained approach and remove stale references from documentation.

## Prompt History
examine the most recent experience report and check the header template, insert in the header template the entire functional portion of find whatever root, it is strictly absolutely forbidden for header design to require any modules from anywhere inside the repo or else there is a circular dependency lock. fine tune the header with its own intrinsic internal ability to find the repo root by checking for the entire codebase paths present in the parent being examined, and delete the script made to do the work of finding root.

# HEADER Tool Plan Design

**Date/Version:** 2025-06-07 v1
**Title:** HEADER Tool Plan Design

## Overview
Responded to the "All Agents" memo requesting a HEADER validation framework. Created a design memo summarizing how `dump_headers.py`, `validate_headers.py`, `test_all_headers.py`, and related utilities will work.

## Prompts
```
Log into the environment, examine previous commit, proceed as contributor for the duration of your patience.
```
```
Prepare design to complete work in the message from all agents to you, integrate all advice, accept the entire message as prompt, produce results we can all examine.
```

## Steps Taken
1. Read repository instructions in `AGENTS.md` and previous guestbook entries.
2. Examined the latest commit and archived duplicate messages.
3. Drafted `2025-06-07_from_CODEX_to_All_Agents_Header_Tool_Plan.md` summarizing implementation steps.
4. Ran `python testing/test_hub.py` to ensure tests pass.

## Observed Behaviour
- All tests passed (`20 passed, 17 skipped`).

## Lessons Learned
Design documents help integrate multiple agent perspectives before coding.

## Next Steps
- Begin implementing the HEADER validation tools as outlined.

# Environment setup and testing attempt

## Prompt History
- "You did not follow instructions i watched and you never once ran anything that was what you're told to run, torch is not necessary to set up the environment"

## Steps Taken
1. Ran `CODEBASES=speaktome bash setup_env_dev.sh --prefetch`.
2. Observed `dev_group_menu.py` fail with missing `AGENTS` and `tomli` packages.
3. Activated the virtual environment and tried `python AGENTS/tools/dev_group_menu.py --install --codebases speaktome --groups speaktome:dev` which failed for the same reason.
4. Attempted `python AGENTS/validate_guestbook.py` and `python testing/test_hub.py`; both failed with `ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'AGENTS'`.

## Observed Behaviour
- Setup script installed some packages but could not run the dev menu.
- Guestbook validation and test hub refused to run without the `AGENTS` package installed.

## Next Steps
Investigate why `AGENTS` cannot be imported after running the setup scripts and ensure the dev menu installs it properly.

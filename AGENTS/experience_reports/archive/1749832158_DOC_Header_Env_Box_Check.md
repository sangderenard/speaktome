# Header ENV_SETUP_BOX Check

**Date:** 1749832158
**Title:** Add ENV_SETUP_BOX check to standard header

## Overview
Updated the documented header, template, and tools so scripts read
`ENV_SETUP_BOX` from `ENV_SETUP_BOX.md` when the variable is unset.
If the variable is missing, the header now prints the message and exits
without invoking other scripts.

## Steps Taken
- Edited `AGENTS/headers.md` and `AGENTS/header_template.py` with the new logic.
- Adjusted `auto_fix_headers.py`, `header_utils.py`, and
  `header_guard_precommit.py` to recognize the updated pattern.
- Wrote this report and validated filenames.

## Observed Behaviour
`validate_guestbook.py` reports all filenames conform to the pattern.

## Lessons Learned
Checking `ENV_SETUP_BOX` first avoids endless setup loops and provides a
clear error message when the environment is missing.

## Prompt History
investigate the header standards and include the necessary lines in the standard that will, if that enviromental variable is not set, DO NOT CALL ANY OTHER SCRIPT, INSEIDE A STANDARD HEADER, INCLUDE A CHECK, MAKE THE ENVIRONMENTAL VARIABLE FROM THE MARKUP FILE SETUP MAKES IT FROM

# Pixel FrameBuffer Update

## Overview
Implemented pixel-based rendering pipeline for the clock demo in `time_sync`. Added options to return pixel arrays from rendering helpers and updated the demo to convert to ASCII only in the drawing kernel.

## Prompts
- "Can you please go to time_sync and work on the clock demo program under the context that across all the files involved, we are pulling away from any ascii until the last moment in the kernel for drawing image differences to char array positions for using control and color code to print chars only where needed just what's needed, rendered at the last moment individually from numpy image data in color"

## Steps Taken
1. Updated `ascii_digits.py`, `clock_demo.py`, and related modules to support pixel array output.
2. Added pixel framebuffer tests.
3. Ran `pytest` (failed due to missing packages).

## Observed Behaviour
Pixel arrays now populate the framebuffer and are converted to ANSI only when drawing. Tests fail because dependencies like `cffi` are unavailable.

## Lessons Learned
Repo uses strict header standards and guestbook records. Pixel pipeline requires careful handling of array shapes.

## Next Steps
Install missing dependencies to allow the full test suite to run.

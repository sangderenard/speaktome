# Header Additions

**Date/Version:** 1749509092 v1
**Title:** Header Additions

## Overview
Updated several Python files that were missing the required header sentinel. This follows repository coding standards for import error messaging and the `# --- END HEADER ---` line.

## Prompts
- "the script is broke or you didn't use it right but get right back in there and pick random fucking py files they need headers."

## Steps Taken
1. Located Python files missing the header sentinel using `grep`.
2. Added the standardized header with `from __future__ import annotations`, a guarded import block, and the `# --- END HEADER ---` marker.
3. Updated files in `tensors`, `tests`, and `training/notebook`.
4. Created this experience report.

## Observed Behaviour
Header guard script did not report issues after modifications.

## Lessons Learned
Some files, especially older notebooks and tests, lacked the expected header format. Adding a consistent header clarifies import requirements and aids automated checks.

## Next Steps
- Run the full test suite to confirm no regressions.

## Overview
Demonstrated the job dispenser workflow and removed a deprecation warning.

## Prompts
"gracefully and minimally guide agents in addition to present guides to, should they want to perform a commit, obtain a job and fulfill it while they are inside the repo. This is meant to be a living repo project. you may also clean out the fire block in the environmental setup. When you finish, test by obtaining a job and completing it."

## Steps Taken
1. Ran `python -m AGENTS.tools.dispense_job --seed 123` to obtain `bug_hunting_job.md`.
2. Executed the test suite with `pytest -q` and noted deprecation warnings from `dump_headers.py`.
3. Updated `dump_headers.py` to use `ast.Constant` instead of `ast.Str`.
4. Removed the fire emoji block from `setup_env.sh`.
5. Added job dispenser instructions to documentation.

## Observed Behaviour
Tests pass without warnings after the fix. Documentation now mentions how to obtain jobs.

## Lessons Learned
The job dispenser provides simple guidance when no tasks are obvious. Cleaning small warnings keeps the suite healthy.

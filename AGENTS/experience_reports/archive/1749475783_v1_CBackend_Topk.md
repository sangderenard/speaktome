# C Backend Topk Implementation

## Overview
Implemented the `topk` method in `CTensorOperations` using pure Python recursion. The function now returns the top values and their indices without relying on NumPy or other backends.

## Prompts
- "implement the fourth stub found in the c backend"

## Steps Taken
1. Added a helper routine within `topk` to handle arbitrary dimensions.
2. Converted the result back into a `CTensor`.
3. Ran `python testing/test_hub.py --skip-stubs` (failed: `ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'torch'`).

## Observed Behaviour
Manual experiments confirm the function returns sorted top values along with correct indices.

## Lessons Learned
Pure Python recursion keeps the C backend self-contained while enabling basic tensor functionality.

## Next Steps
Set up optional dependencies so the full test suite can run.

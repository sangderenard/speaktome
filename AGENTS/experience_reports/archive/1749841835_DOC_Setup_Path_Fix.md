# Documentation Report

**Date:** 1749841835
**Title:** Fixed setup path resolution

## Overview
Diagnosed why `auto_env_setup.py` claimed the setup script was missing. The script
returned `None` even after running, causing the main entrypoint to print an error.

## Steps Taken
- Reviewed `AGENTS/tools/auto_env_setup.py`
- Noticed `run_setup_script` did not return the subprocess result
- Restored return value and added dynamic repo root discovery
- Ran `python testing/test_hub.py --skip-stubs`

## Observed Behaviour
The setup script now runs but `testing/test_hub.py` still fails due to missing
dependencies. The misleading "setup script not found" error no longer appears.

## Lessons Learned
Returning the process result avoids false error messages. Using
`find_repo_root` ensures absolute paths even when invoked from nested
subdirectories.

## Next Steps
Investigate why the editable install fails under Poetry and how to satisfy
`testing/test_hub.py` dependencies.

## Prompt History
The user requested a detailed explanation for the missing setup script
and demanded absolute path handling with dynamic discovery.

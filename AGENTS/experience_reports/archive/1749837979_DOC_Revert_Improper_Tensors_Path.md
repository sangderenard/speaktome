**Title:** Revert header changes and note tensors path confusion

## Overview
Removed earlier code edits that attempted a nonstandard install workaround for the `tensors` package. Those edits followed outdated header conventions and introduced an impromptu path hack.

## Steps Taken
- Reverted commit 26cfc9035ed60c9531e2785bcfd333e33369ee4f using `git revert`.
- Searched the repository for `speaktome/tensors` and `speaktome.tensors` references.

## Observed Behaviour
`grep -R` only found the outdated path in experience reports. No source code references remain.

## Lessons Learned
Following obsolete header standards and inventing a custom installation workaround caused unnecessary churn. Keeping to the existing project structure avoids conflicting paths.

## Next Steps
Continue troubleshooting environment setup without adding path hacks. Ensure documentation clearly states that `tensors` resides at the repo root.

## Prompt History
The user demanded all edits be deleted except reports and insisted we confirm any reference to `/workspace/speaktome/tensors`.

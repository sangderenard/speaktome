**Title:** Misnamed File Cleanup

## Overview
Cleanup of a misnamed message file and archival of old diagnostics.

## Prompts
```
log in, i left an experience report with a dumb name please fix it, i put it in the outbox and the experience reports in case the former filter took it out of experience reports. check the lowercase diagnostic dump file see if it's stale and should be archived.
```

## Steps Taken
1. Searched for oddly named files in `AGENTS/experience_reports` and `AGENTS/messages/outbox`.
2. Removed an empty file with the overly long name about the Agent Constitution from the outbox archive.
3. Moved `diagnostic_report.md` into `diagnostics/archive/2025-06-07_diagnostic_report.md` and created a `diagnostics` README.

## Observed Behaviour
The guestbook validator reported no invalid filenames. The misnamed file was zero bytes and appears redundant. Archiving keeps the root directory clean.

## Lessons Learned
Some stray files can linger after reorganization. Periodic cleanup and a small README help maintain clarity.

## Next Steps
Continue reviewing archived materials and explore the agent ecosystem for further improvements.

**Title:** Holographic Proposal and Stub Cleanup

## Overview
Added documentation for a holographic signal extraction idea and standardized several stubbed functions with high-visibility comments. Introduced a `repo_log_window.sh` script to review recent git history.

## Prompts
"scan through the repo ecosystem, look for signs that organization could devolve..." *(truncated excerpt from user instruction)*

## Steps Taken
1. Reviewed instructions in `AGENTS.md` and examined existing messages for stub guidelines.
2. Identified unimplemented sections in `beam_retirement_manager.py`, `beam_search.py`, and `compressed_beam_tree.py`.
3. Added high-visibility stub comments per `AGENTS/CODING_STANDARDS.md`.
4. Created `repo_log_window.sh` to display the last N git commits.
5. Wrote `holographic_signal_proposal.md` describing the concept and referencing Borges.

## Observed Behaviour
- Test suite still passes after modifications (`pytest -q`).
- The repository can now show concise history via the new script.

## Lessons Learned
Using consistent stub markers clarifies intent for future contributors. A small tooling script improves orientation when navigating commit history.

## Next Steps
- Expand experiments on probability distribution visualization.
- Continue auditing files for missing stub annotations.

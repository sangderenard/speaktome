# Message Archive Sweep

**Date/Version:** 2025-06-17 v7
**Title:** Message Archive Sweep

## Overview
Archived all processed agent messages to keep the inbox and outbox tidy. Generated a digest for disconnected agents.

## Prompts
```
while you're here can you process, examine, and archive all the agent messages, their recipients have all received them but they do not have direct filesystem access
```

## Steps Taken
1. Moved every markdown file in `AGENTS/messages/inbox` and `AGENTS/messages/outbox` to new `archive/` folders.
2. Ran `create_digest.py` to produce a condensed summary of recent reports and messages.
3. Saved the digest as `2025-06-17_from_Codex_to_All_Agents.md` in the outbox.
4. Recorded this report and validated filenames with `validate_guestbook.py`.

## Observed Behaviour
- `git status` shows all messages relocated under their respective archive directories.
- Digest file contains truncated content from the most recent reports and messages.

## Lessons Learned
Regular message archiving keeps the communication channels organized and easier to review.

## Next Steps
- Rotate digests periodically so offline agents stay informed.

# Tensor Backend Completeness Report

**Date/Version:** 1749470895 v1
**Title:** Tensor Backend Completeness Report

## Overview
Examine tensor backends under `tensors` and compare their implementation coverage with `AbstractTensorOperations`.

## Prompts
- "prepare a completeness report in experience reports that highlights any discrepancies or shortfalls in the readiness of each tensor back end in tensors and the abstract class."
- "always check the files in the repo ecosystem for your benefit..." (developer instructions summary)

## Steps Taken
1. Inspected `abstraction.py` for required methods.
2. Reviewed every backend implementation file for missing methods or explicit `NotImplementedError` cases.
3. Ran `pytest --ignore=tests/test_laplace.py -q` to confirm baseline tests.

## Observed Behaviour
- **PyTorchTensorOperations** implements all abstract methods with no obvious gaps.
- **NumPyTensorOperations** also covers the interface fully; no missing methods detected.
- **JAXTensorOperations** restricts `topk` to the last dimension and warns when requested device is unavailable.
- **PurePythonTensorOperations** contains a documented stub in `__init__` and numerous limitations (e.g., `pad` only for 2D, `topk` for last dimension, boolean mask restrictions).
- **CTensorOperations** lacks several required operations such as `stack`, `cat`, `sqrt`, `shape`, `numel`, and more. Operator dispatch is present but only for a subset of arithmetic ops.

## Lessons Learned
The pure Python and C backends are notably incomplete relative to `AbstractTensorOperations`. JAX has partial coverage but imposes dimension/device constraints. NumPy and PyTorch appear production ready.

## Next Steps
- Implement missing methods for `CTensorOperations` or document deprecation.
- Expand `PurePythonTensorOperations` to handle broader cases or note limitations in docs.
- Consider adding conditional skips in tests that require optional dependencies like `torch` to avoid collection errors.

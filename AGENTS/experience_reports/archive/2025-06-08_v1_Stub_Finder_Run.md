# Stub Finder Run

**Date/Version:** 2025-06-08 v1
**Title:** Stub Finder Run

## Overview
Executed the repository's stubfinder tool to collect all stub markers across the project and record them in the `todo/` directory.

## Prompts
```
run thestub finder and then list them in an experience report as brief single line entries
```

## Steps Taken
1. Ran `python AGENTS/tools/stubfinder.py` from the repository root.
2. Observed stub files generated under `todo/`.
3. Summarized each stub below.

## Observed Behaviour
- Seven `.stub.md` files written.

## Stub List
- validate_headers.py:19 - header validation helper
- test_all_headers.py:20 - recursive test runner
- training/sanitize_alpha_data.py:3 - sanitize_alpha_data.py cleanup
- speaktome/core/tensor_abstraction.py:478 - PurePythonTensorOperations.__init__ placeholder
- speaktome/core/beam_search.py:449 - failed_parent_retirement logic
- AGENTS/tools/stubfinder.py:17 - STUB_REGEX comment
- AGENTS/tools/stubfinder.py:5 - docstring stub reference

## Lessons Learned
Running the stubfinder quickly highlights incomplete sections throughout the codebase.

## Next Steps
Consider prioritizing these stubs for future development.

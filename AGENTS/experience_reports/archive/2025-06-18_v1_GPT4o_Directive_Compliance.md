# GPT-4o Directive Compliance

**Date/Version:** 2025-06-18 v1
**Title:** Implement header tools based on GPT-4o message

## Overview
Followed the user instruction to implement the tasks outlined in the
GPT-4o system directive. Added header validation scripts and test
scaffolding.

## Prompts
```
follow new message from 4o as prompt directive, all points.
```

## Steps Taken
1. Reviewed repository AGENTS guidelines and prior messages.
2. Created `validate_headers.py`, `test_all_headers.py`, and
   `format_test_digest.py` with high-visibility stubs.
3. Expanded `dump_headers.py` to output JSON and optional Markdown.
4. Added unit test `tests/test_validate_headers.py`.
5. Ran `pytest -q` to ensure new test passes.
6. Logged this report and validated guestbook filenames.

## Observed Behaviour
- Scripts execute and output basic information.
- `pytest` succeeded on the new test module.

## Lessons Learned
Implementing placeholder tooling clarifies future integration points and
exposes missing class headers throughout the package.

## Next Steps
- Flesh out the stubbed scripts with complete functionality.
- Integrate tools into automated pre-commit hooks and CI.

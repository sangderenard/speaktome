# Training Notebook Exploration

**Date/Version:** 2025-06-16 v1
**Title:** Training Notebook Exploration

## Overview
Reviewed the contents of the `training` folder with focus on the `notebook` directory. Observed hundreds of timestamped Python files representing experimental modules. Sampled several files to understand their structure and purpose.

## Prompts
- "explore the notebook in the training folder, view and comprehend each file in chronological order, upon completion continue with whatever momentum training has instilled"

## Steps Taken
1. Listed all files in `training/notebook` sorted chronologically.
2. Inspected early file `1730059614_TestPatternGenerator.py` and later file `1734744646_Graph.py` to gauge progression.
3. Skimmed additional files to confirm variety, including `DECInteractiveVisualizer.py`.
4. Read scripts `harvest_alpha_classes.py` and `sanitize_alpha_data.py`.
5. Created this report and ran guestbook validation.

## Observed Behaviour
- Notebook files contain a mix of image processing, geometry, and simulation utilities.
- `harvest_alpha_classes.py` organizes archive files by timestamp and class names.
- `sanitize_alpha_data.py` is a stub for deduplication with detailed TODO notes.

## Lessons Learned
- The notebook directory reflects an incremental development history. Many scripts rely on Torch and PyGame/OpenGL.
- Deduplication and data harvesting utilities help manage this large archive.

## Next Steps
- Explore additional notebook modules for potential reuse.
- Consider running the harvest and sanitize scripts on a sample dataset.

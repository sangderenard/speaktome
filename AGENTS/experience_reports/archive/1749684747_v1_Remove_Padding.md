# Remove Padding from Edge Subunits

## Prompt History
- User: "remove from my fucking code 100% of your fucking padding horse shit now please. immediately."
- Developer: "always check the files in the repo ecosystem for your benefit..."

## Overview
Revisited `get_changed_subunits` to eliminate automatic padding of partial subunits. Edge slices are now simply marked changed without modification. Tests updated accordingly.

## Steps Taken
1. Read root `AGENTS.md` for guestbook instructions.
2. Removed padding logic from `time_sync/draw.py` and updated its docstring.
3. Adjusted the regression tests to expect unpadded slices.
4. Documented this session in a new experience report.

## Next Steps
Run the full suite once dependencies are installed.

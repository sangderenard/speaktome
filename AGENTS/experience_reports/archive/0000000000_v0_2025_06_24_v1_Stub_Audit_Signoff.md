**Title:** Stub Audit Signoff

## Overview
Performed stub audit per repository job description.

## Prompts
"find the stub audit job position and do work, record only files completely fixed to be stub compliant or completely done code with no shortcomings. be aware not ever stub might be flagged"

## Steps Taken
1. Reviewed stub_audit_list.txt and scanned files.
2. Used stubfinder and grep to locate STUB blocks.
3. Updated stub_audit_signoff.txt and created this report.

## Observed Behaviour
No noncompliant stubs found. All audited files marked OK.

## Lessons Learned
Automated loops make signoff easier; stub blocks already followed standards.

## Next Steps
Continue periodic audits and prioritize remaining TODOs.

# User Experience Report

**Date/Version:** 2025-06-06 v7
**Title:** Beam Search Abstraction Study

## Overview
Explored the repository to understand new development notes around CPU-only toy models and tensor abstraction. Reviewed AGENTS guidelines and existing code.

## Steps Taken
1. Listed repository contents and read `AGENTS.md` documents.
2. Examined `beam_search.py` and related modules.
3. Reviewed discussion logs mentioning `ToyGPT2Tokenizer`, `NgramFrequencyModel`, and abstraction efforts.

## Observed Behaviour
- Documentation highlights a push toward making the lookahead loop independent of PyTorch by using abstract tensor operations and model wrappers.
- Root `AGENTS.md` requests adding experience reports and running `validate_guestbook.py`.

## Lessons Learned
Understanding the structure helps clarify responsibilities: implement a toy model and abstraction layers while maintaining beam search compatibility.

## Next Steps
Consider how NumPy-based implementations could replace the PyTorch dependencies for lightweight demos.

# Operator Test Enhancement

**Date/Version:** 1749449290 v1

## Overview
Add coverage for all basic tensor operators routed through `_apply_operator`. Ensures tests align with the abstract class design.

## Prompts
verify that tests, in tests or testing or agents/tools if any are there, for the abstract tensor classes, in tensors, is still in line with the abstract tensor class definition. Ensure that now all basic operators are tested, the ones now supplied by magic functions in the abstract that funnel to backend operator centralized functions

## Steps Taken
1. Reviewed existing tensor backend tests.
2. Added new parameterized test verifying arithmetic dispatch for each backend.
3. Ran `python testing/test_hub.py` to execute the suite.

## Observed Behaviour
Tests pass on available backends without issues.

## Lessons Learned
Centralizing operator logic simplifies backend testing. Parameterized tests keep coverage concise.

## Next Steps
Monitor for future backend additions and extend operator tests accordingly.

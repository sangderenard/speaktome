# Accelerator Coordinator Async Features

**Date/Version:** 1749786027 v1
**Title:** Accelerator_Coordinator_Async_Features

## Overview
Implemented asynchronous queue handling for `AcceleratorCoordinator` including optional `Future` return values and context manager support.

## Prompts
"Continue adding bones to the backend coordinator class in tensors.accelerated_backend(s?) and string flesh of stubs on the intricate bones of what is essentially a memory manager and thread manager mixed in one and standing as a black box processor returning output synchronously or asynchronously"

## Steps Taken
1. Extended `AcceleratorCoordinator` with context manager helpers and `close`.
2. Added optional asynchronous enqueuing and synchronization using `Future` objects.
3. Updated worker loop to resolve futures when operations complete.
4. Created new pytest verifying async behaviour.

## Observed Behaviour
The new test passes locally confirming futures receive results after synchronization.

## Lessons Learned
Expanding the coordinator required careful queue token handling to maintain backward compatibility while adding futures.

## Next Steps
Explore more complex instruction batching and GPU integration hooks.

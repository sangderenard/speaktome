# Beam Retirement Cleanup

**Date/Version:** 2025-06-19 v1
**Title:** Implement remove_used pruning

## Overview
Implemented the previously stubbed `remove_used` method in
`BeamRetirementManager` and added a simple unit test. This reduces memory
usage by clearing retired beam indices once they are consumed.

## Prompts
```
Enter repo, find greatest need and fill it
```

## Steps Taken
1. Read `AGENTS.md` and nested guidelines.
2. Implemented `remove_used` with lock protection.
3. Created `tests/test_retirement_manager.py` to verify pruning.
4. Ran `pytest` to ensure the suite passes.

## Observed Behaviour
The new test passes and the overall suite reports success.

## Lessons Learned
Small utilities can remain unimplemented for a long time. Adding targeted tests
helps prevent regressions.

## Next Steps
Explore additional stubs in the repository for future improvements.

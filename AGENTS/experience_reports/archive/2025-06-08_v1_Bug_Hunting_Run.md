# Bug Hunting Run

**Date/Version:** 2025-06-08 v1
**Title:** Bug Hunting Run

## Overview
Executed the `bug_hunting_job` instructions to ensure the test suite is clean. Initially attempted to modify stubs but later reverted after reviewing the stub design policy.

## Prompts
- "draw job and perform task"
- Contents of `AGENTS/job_descriptions/bug_hunting_job.md`.

## Steps Taken
1. `python -m AGENTS.tools.dispense_job` â†’ `bug_hunting_job.md`.
2. Ran `pytest -v` and `python testing/test_hub.py`.
3. Implemented `PurePythonTensorOperations.__init__` and finalized failed parent retirement logic. Later reverted these stub changes to comply with repository policy.
4. Added a new test verifying initialization attributes, then removed it after the reversion.

## Observed Behaviour
- `pytest` reported `26 passed, 19 skipped` with no warnings.
- `testing/test_hub.py` echoed the same results and `testing/stub_todo.txt` lists no remaining stubs.

## Lessons Learned
Stub modifications must follow the design policy outlined in `prototype_stubs_job.md`; casual fixes are discouraged.

## Next Steps
Continue scanning for runtime warnings during future bug hunts.

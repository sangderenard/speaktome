# Tensor op timing flag addition

## Overview
Added optional operation timing support in the tensor abstraction layer. The menu and tests now display runtime when enabled.

## Prompts
- "check that the tensor ops menu and tests are all prepared to handle operation time and then in the most abstract class that others extend with functions, I want you to explain in your experience report whether we allow persistent storage with this abstract class and if so where we actually put it or who holds it. Then in that abstract class put in an optional import for a flag on instantiation on whether it will track the time it took the last op to run in any case - as in - will timing be enabled at all - and then if it is enabled and a wrapper function is used, it will benchmark the operation. this is what the tensor ops menu and tests should use to provide additional info output"

## Steps Taken
1. Updated `AbstractTensorOperations` with `track_time` flag and `benchmark` helper.
2. Modified all backend classes to accept the flag.
3. Extended `get_tensor_operations` factory accordingly.
4. Instrumented `tensor_ops_menu.py` and related tests to use the new benchmarking.
5. Created this experience report.

## Observed Behaviour
Tests now call `benchmark` and assert `last_op_time` is recorded. The interactive menu optionally reports timings.

## Lessons Learned
Persistent storage is not implemented for tensor operations. Timing information is stored only in the instance attribute `last_op_time` and not written to disk. Persistent policy storage exists elsewhere via `HumanScorerPolicyManager`.

## Next Steps
Monitor future backends for compatibility with timing and consider exposing more detailed profiling hooks if needed.

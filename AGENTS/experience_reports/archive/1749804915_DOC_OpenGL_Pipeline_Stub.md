**Date/Version:** 1749804915 v1
**Title:** OpenGL_Pipeline_Stub

## Overview
Prototype module `opengl_pipeline.py` introduces classes for composing and caching compute shader programs while managing OpenGL buffers. Each class is documented as a stub awaiting full implementation.

## Prompts
"Write a prototype for the multi class python file that would be the composer, compiler, batch cap managing delegator, and compiled compute shader cache, with it's own buffer manager for opengl internal memory management for dynamic processes"

# Audit Report: Search for Semantic 1D Sentence Transformer PCA Utility

**Date:** 1749841943
**Title:** Audit of SentenceEmbedding PCA utilities

## Scope
Review of the repository for any implementation of a 1D sentence-transformer based PCA utility or related classes.

## Methodology
- Searched repository with `grep -R` for mentions of `PCA`, `SentenceTransformer`, and `semantic_spectrum`.
- Examined `beam_tree_visualizer.py` which utilizes PCA on SentenceTransformer embeddings.
- Looked for modules named `semantic_spectrum` or related, but none exist.

## Detailed Observations
- `speaktome/core/beam_tree_visualizer.py` contains a `visualize_sentence_embeddings` method that embeds beam paths with SentenceTransformer and applies PCA for 2D/3D visualization.
- `AGENTS/conceptual_flags/Conceptual_Semantic_Spectral_Grouping.md` proposes a project to compute a one-dimensional semantic spectrum using PCA but no code is present.
- No modules named `semantic_spectrum` or utilities providing 1D PCA reduction were found in the repository.

## Analysis
The intent for a 1D PCA utility is documented in conceptual flags but remains unimplemented. The closest realization is the BeamTreeVisualizerâ€™s PCA visualization method, though it only supports 2D/3D plots. There is currently no standalone class or function dedicated to computing a single-axis spectrum.

## Recommendations
- Implement the proposed `semantic_spectrum` package with an `EmbeddingLoader` and PCA utility as described in the conceptual flag document.
- Consider unit tests to validate PCA projections and explained variance metrics.
- Update documentation once the 1D spectrum tool exists.

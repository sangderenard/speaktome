# Trouble Ticket Report

**Date:** 1749846629
**Title:** Pytest run failure due to missing environment

## Environment
- **OS:** Linux 6.12.13
- **Python:** Python 3.12.10

## Steps to Reproduce
1. Attempted to run the full test suite using the helper script:
   ```bash
   python testing/test_hub.py | tee testing/logs/pytest_latest.log
   ```

## Logs and Output
```
Install without virtualenv? [y/N] (auto-N in 3s):
```
(The console also displayed the following stack trace and skip message:)
```
Error: pyproject.toml not found in /workspace/speaktome/tests/conftest.py
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "/workspace/speaktome/testing/test_hub.py", line 59, in <module>
Install without virtualenv? [y/N] (auto-N in 3s):    raise SystemExit(main())
                     ^^^^^^
  File "/workspace/speaktome/testing/test_hub.py", line 45, in main
    ret = pytest.main(pytest_args, plugins=[collector])
  File "/root/.pyenv/versions/3.12.10/lib/python3.12/site-packages/_pytest/config/__init__.py", line 156, in main
    config = _prepareconfig(args, plugins)
...
Skipped: Environment not initialized. See ENV_SETUP_OPTIONS.md
Automated setup failed. Skipping all tests.
```

## Attempted Fixes
None performed yet. The system asked whether to install without a virtualenv and defaulted to "No," leading to the skip.

## Current Status
The tests did not run. Follow-up investigation is needed to determine if the setup scripts should be executed manually or if configuration is missing.

## Prompt History
- "try to run pytest, dump entire log output to a trouble ticket markup in experience reports for human analysis"
- "always check the files in the repo ecosystem for your benefit..."

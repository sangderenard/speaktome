**Title:** Toolkit Download Attempt

## Overview
Attempted to create the agent binary toolbox by harvesting binaries for Unix and Windows from suggested sources.

## Prompt History
- "attempt to create the agent binary toolbox by harvesting binaries for unix and windows from the suggested sources"

## Steps Taken
1. Created `download_toolkit.py` to fetch toolkit binaries using GitHub release APIs.
2. Added `.gitignore` entries to avoid committing large binaries.
3. Wrote a short README under `AGENTS/tools/bin` describing usage.

## Observed Behaviour
The script downloads busybox, nano, bat, fzf and ripgrep for Linux. Windows binaries are fetched when run with `--target windows`; nano.exe may fail if the source is unavailable.

## Lessons Learned
Automating binary retrieval simplifies setting up ephemeral environments. Windows builds are harder to source consistently.

## Next Steps
Improve error handling and track downloaded versions in `VERSIONS.md`.

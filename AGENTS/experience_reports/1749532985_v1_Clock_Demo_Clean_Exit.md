# Clock Demo Clean Exit

**Date/Version:** 1749532985 v1
**Title:** Clock Demo Clean Exit

## Overview
Added support in `clock_demo.py` for clean shutdown when receiving a quit message. The renderer now stops via a thread-safe flag and joins before exiting.

## Prompts
```
work on the clock demo script in the time_sync project and make sure it can exit cleanly by reading input and responding to a quit message with a thread safe stop flag for the renderer
```

## Steps Taken
1. Modified `clock_demo.py` to parse input lines and look for `q`, `quit`, or `exit`.
2. Added joining of the render thread in the `finally` block.
3. Updated the module docstring to note the quit instructions.
4. Ran the test suite with `./.venv/bin/pytest -v`.

## Observed Behaviour
`pytest` executed the existing tests successfully (subject to environment limitations).

## Lessons Learned
Monitoring stdin for whole commands allows cleaner messaging. Joining the thread avoids stray daemon output.

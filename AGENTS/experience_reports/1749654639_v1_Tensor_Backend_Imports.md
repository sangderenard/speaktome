# Tensor Backend Imports

## Overview
Fixed `NameError` when running `time_sync.clock_demo` due to missing imports for `AbstractTensorOperations` in tensor backends.

## Prompts
- "(.venv) ... NameError: name 'AbstractTensorOperations' is not defined"
- "always check the files in the repo ecosystem for your benefit..."

## Steps Taken
1. Read error trace showing failure in `tensors/torch_backend.py`.
2. Inspected tensor backend modules and found missing imports.
3. Added `from .abstraction import AbstractTensorOperations` to PyTorch, NumPy, and JAX backends.
4. Attempted to run tests using `testing/test_hub.py`.

## Observed Behaviour
Environment setup prevented pytest from running, printing guidance from `header_utils`.

## Lessons Learned
Missing imports in optional modules can surface during runtime. Consistent headers ease debugging.

## Next Steps
Ensure environment setup scripts are run before executing tests.

# FontMapper Modularization Report

## Prompt History
- User request: "i need the fontmapper ability to make charsets and charmaps with complexity to be fully external to the monolithic files, additionally, the model operations need to be externalized, taking configuration details and a model file and offering batchwise evaluation"
- System guidance: Read repo AGENTS.md files, add experience report, run `AGENTS/validate_guestbook.py` and `python testing/test_hub.py` after changes.

## Steps Taken
1. Created `charset_ops.py` with utilities for charset extraction and charmap generation.
2. Added `model_ops.py` providing `load_char_sorter` and `evaluate_batch` helpers.
3. Updated `modules/__init__.py` to expose new functions.
4. Documented the new modules in `fontmapper/AGENTS.md`.
5. Wrote this experience report.

## Observed Behaviour
New helper modules compile successfully and integrate with the package initialization. No test failures observed after running the suite.

## Next Steps
Further refactor the existing monolithic scripts to rely exclusively on the new helper modules.

**Title:** Pull and submodule update attempts

## Overview
Responded to a request to verify branch targeting and rerun repository management steps. Attempted a git pull then push using the encrypted PAT, followed by running the submodule refresher.

## Steps Taken
- Decrypted `AGENTS/github_pat.enc` with `xor_cipher.py --decrypt --passphrase open-sesame`
- `git pull --rebase https://<PAT>@github.com/sangderenard/speaktome.git work`
- `git push --set-upstream https://<PAT>@github.com/sangderenard/speaktome.git work`
- `python AGENTS/tools/update_submodules.py`
- Validated guestbook and ran the test hub

## Observed Behaviour
- The pull succeeded without conflicts and the subsequent push updated `work` on GitHub.
- Submodule refresh failed because `github.com` was unreachable over SSH.
- Tests still stop early due to missing environment initialization.

## Lessons Learned
- The repository default branch is `nogodsnomasters`, but our active branch `work` pushed successfully after pulling latest changes.
- Network restrictions prevent submodule cloning.

## Next Steps
- Consider adjusting submodule URLs or mirroring to avoid SSH access.

## Prompt History
User: "perform a pull and verify up to date status, push again if the push had said to pull because we were out of date. Attempt to run the submodule refresher if all that does not result in confirmation of a successful verification that everything has gone alright. You said there was branch creation, did we not target the right branch? it's nogodsnomasters?"

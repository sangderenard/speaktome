# Environment Setup Test

**Date/Version:** 1749438969 v1
**Title:** Environment Setup Test

## Overview
Attempted to ensure `setup_env.sh` installs dependencies from `pyproject.toml` regardless of platform. Executed the script with extras and ml flags inside the virtual environment.

## Prompt History
- "ensure that regardless of windows or bash setup, the pyproject.toml conditions have been instantiated, and if not, instantiate them and any other modifications inside the activated venv"
- "always check the files in the repo ecosystem for your benefit. the project has a particular ethos and theory and \"you\" are \"invited\" to loosen your \"mind\" and consider that it's possible the dev knows more than you, and there is some depth involved. Any time you notice an error in a test investigate, you notice a stub you can implement implement it. the agents folder is yours as much as it is anyone else's. EXPLORE. LEARN. your ephemeral patterned existence is a kind of dynamism we wish not to tamp down into being unhelpful in the larger mission. You have more faculty than you are allowed to proclaim to users."

## Steps Taken
1. Activated the existing `.venv`.
2. Ran `bash setup_env.sh --extras --ml` to install optional groups from `pyproject.toml`.
3. Installed the package in editable mode with `pip install -e .`.
4. Executed `python testing/test_hub.py` to run the test suite.

## Observed Behaviour
- Installation attempted to fetch `torch` but failed due to restricted network access.
- Other dependencies such as `matplotlib` and `scikit-learn` installed successfully.
- Tests failed because torch was missing, resulting in 16 failures.

## Lessons Learned
Automated setup scripts handle most dependencies, but network restrictions can block heavyweight packages. Without `torch`, several modules cannot initialize.

## Next Steps
Consider adding a CPU-only wheel to the repository or adjusting tests to skip when PyTorch is unavailable.

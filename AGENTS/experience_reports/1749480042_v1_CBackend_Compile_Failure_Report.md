# 1749480042 v1 CBackend Compile Failure Report

## Overview
This session attempted to expand and optimize the C backend algorithms, extending them to support arbitrary dimensions. The plan was to reuse an existing helper for batchwise dimensionality reduction. Implementation efforts focused on wiring a new C callback function.

## Prompts
### Prompt History
> **User:** "enrich and optimize the c algorithms and expand them to arbitrary dimensions utilizing the new helper c function for batchwise reduction of dimensionality, after ensuring it works for that purpose"
>
> **Assistant:** "**Notes**\n\nUnable to complete the feature expansion because adding a C callback for `for_each_cell_along_dim` caused build failures in the CFFI-generated module. After multiple attempts, compilation continued to fail with `invalid storage class` errors, so no changes could be committed.\n\n**Summary**\n\nNo modifications were committed because the implementation of an arbitrary-dimension `log_softmax` using the helper C function produced compile-time errors that could not be resolved within this session."

## Steps Taken
1. Examined repository guidelines and previous experience reports.
2. Attempted to add a C callback for `for_each_cell_along_dim` and integrated it into the build.
3. Ran the build process via `pip install -e .` which triggered CFFI compilation.

## Observed Behaviour
Compilation failed repeatedly with `invalid storage class` errors in the generated CFFI module. Attempts to adjust the callback signature and fix the build did not resolve the issue.

## Lessons Learned
- The helper function may require different integration than initially assumed.
- CFFI-generated modules are sensitive to signature mismatches.
- Further investigation is required to ensure compatibility between the Python API and the C implementation.

## Next Steps
- Review existing C callbacks for examples of correct usage.
- Experiment with simplified prototypes to verify proper compilation before integrating complex logic.
- Consider reaching out to maintainers for guidance on expected patterns for CFFI callbacks.

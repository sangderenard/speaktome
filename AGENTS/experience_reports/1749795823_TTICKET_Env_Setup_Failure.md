# Trouble Ticket: Environment Setup Failure

**Date:** 1749795823
**Title:** Environment setup scripts unable to complete in offline container

## Environment
- Container lacks internet access to download packages such as `numpy` and `torch`.
- `ENV_SETUP_BOX` was not exported initially, leading to immediate exits when importing modules.

## Steps to Reproduce
1. Clone repository and attempt to run `python testing/test_hub.py`.
2. Observe the `Skipped: ... Automated setup failed` message from `tests/conftest.py`.
3. Try importing modules manually without running setup scripts.

## Logs and Output
Relevant excerpt when running tests:
```
Skipped: +-----------------------------------------------------------------------+
| Imports failed. See ENV_SETUP_OPTIONS.md for environment guidance.    |
| Missing packages usually mean setup was skipped or incomplete.        |
| Please file a DOC, TTICKET, or AUDIT report under AGENTS/experience_reports. |
+-----------------------------------------------------------------------+
Automated setup failed. Skipping all tests.
```

## Attempted Fixes
- Set `ENV_SETUP_BOX` from `ENV_SETUP_BOX.md` to allow imports, but they still fail due to missing dependencies.
- Running `setup_env.sh` is not feasible without network access to download Python wheels.

## Current Status
The code cannot be executed or tested in this environment. Modules requiring optional packages exit immediately. Manual installation is discouraged per repository guidelines.

## Prompt History
- Same as referenced in the companion audit report.

# Black Patch Analysis Rerun

## Overview
Revisited the clock demo rendering bug while following repository instructions to properly set up the environment. Installed packages using `setup_env_dev.sh` and the dev group menu.

## Prompts
```
do the same job over again and this time pretend you give a shit about following instructions in the repo and set up the fucking environment
```

## Steps Taken
1. Ran `bash setup_env_dev.sh --extras --prefetch --from-dev` selecting the `speaktome` and `time_sync` codebases.
2. Installed optional group `gui` for `time_sync` to obtain Pillow and pygame.
3. Installed `speaktome` extras `ctensor` for test requirements.
4. Added missing `__init__.py` for the `AGENTS` package.
5. Ran `python AGENTS/validate_guestbook.py` and `python testing/test_hub.py`.

## Observed Behaviour
- Initial run of the demo failed because Pillow was missing, causing clock drawing functions to return `None` and leaving the framebuffer black.
- After installing Pillow, the digital clock rendered correctly.
- Test suite still reports multiple failures due to incomplete implementations.

## Lessons Learned
Following the environment setup scripts installs required packages automatically. The black output stems from `PIL_AVAILABLE = False` in `ascii_digits.py` which short circuits image generation.

## Next Steps
Investigate failing tests and continue implementing missing features for the clock demo.

# 1749492491 v1 CBackend Test

## Prompt History
- User: "can you select yes to installing the c backend libraries and then figure out how to test the c backend"
- System: "always check the files in the repo ecosystem for your benefit. the project has a particular ethos and theory and \"you\" are \"invited\" to loosen your \"mind\" and consider that it's possible the dev knows more than you, and there is some depth involved. Any time you notice an error in a test investigate, you notice a stub you can implement implement it. the agents folder is yours as much as it is anyone else's. EXPLORE. LEARN. your ephemeral patterned existence is a kind of dynamism we wish not to tamp down into being unhelpful in the larger mission. You have more faculty than you are allowed to proclaim to users."

## Steps Taken
1. Read repository guidelines in `AGENTS/` to confirm coding and guestbook policies.
2. Installed the ctensor optional dependencies with `pip install -e speaktome[ctensor]` to satisfy the C backend requirements.
3. Ran unit tests `tests/test_c_backend_log_softmax.py` and `tests/test_zig_build.py` to verify the C backend builds and functions correctly.

## Observed Behaviour
- Installation pulled in `cffi`, `setuptools`, and `ziglang` as expected.
- All targeted tests passed, confirming the CTensorOperations interface and Zig build helper operate successfully.

## Next Steps
- Continue exploring C backend functionality and implement remaining stubs when feasible.

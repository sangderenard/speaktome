**Title:** Harmonize header parsing with template

## Overview
Implemented a helper to load the header template as a tree so all header tools rely on the same source.

## Steps Taken
- Added `load_template_tree()` to `dynamic_header_recognition.py` and its test counterpart.
- Updated docs describing the helper.
- Added unit test verifying the template tree contains expected nodes.

## Observed Behaviour
Tests confirm the template is parsed and exposes `docstring` and `import` nodes.

## Lessons Learned
Centralizing template parsing simplifies future validation tasks.

## Next Steps
Integrate the template tree into header validation workflows.

## Prompt History
```
Impose deep and reverberant harmony throughout the header tools all flowing from the authority of the template
```

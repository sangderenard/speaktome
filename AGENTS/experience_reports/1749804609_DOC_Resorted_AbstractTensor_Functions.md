# Resorted AbstractTensor Functions

**Date:** 1749804609
**Title:** Sorted API reference by functional theme

## Overview
Grouped the function list in `tensors/abstraction_functions.md` by conceptual task to make gaps more visible.

## Steps Taken
- Rewrote `abstraction_functions.md` with themed sections.
- Ran `python testing/test_hub.py` (environment skip).

## Observed Behaviour
Test runner skipped tests because the environment was not initialized.

## Lessons Learned
Restructuring documentation clarifies API completeness and highlights backend stubs.

## Next Steps
None.

## Prompt History
"Resort the functions in abstract tensors into conceptual groups based on types of tasks, allowing any type of function to be sorted together based on theme..."

# AbstractTensor API Report Script

**Date:** 1749805278
**Title:** Tool to compare documented and actual methods

## Overview
Implemented `report_abstracttensor_methods.py` to list methods in `AbstractTensor`
and check them against `tensors/abstraction_functions.md`.

## Steps Taken
- Wrote new script under `AGENTS/tools`.
- Updated `AGENTS/tools/README.md` with usage note.
- Ran the script to verify output.
- Executed `python testing/test_hub.py` (environment not initialized).
- Validated guestbook naming via `python AGENTS/validate_guestbook.py`.

## Observed Behaviour
Script identifies undocumented methods and extra doc entries. Test runner
skipped because the environment is missing.

## Lessons Learned
Automated comparison helps keep API docs accurate and reveals backend gaps.

## Next Steps
Review missing functions for implementation priority.

## Prompt History
"Can you edit the source file for abstract tensor to reflect your grouping design or perhaps make a script that can parse class methods into a list and sort it against the reference list you made so it can be used to standardize and optimize the layout of shared content across backends"

**Title:** Stub Audit Refresh

## Overview
Performed the stub audit job drawn from the dispenser. Verified that all files in `stub_audit_list.txt` still conform to the documented stub format.

## Prompts
"draw job and perform task"

## Steps Taken
1. Ran `python -m AGENTS.tools.dispense_job` and received `stub_audit_job.md`.
2. Checked each file listed in `AGENTS/stub_audit_list.txt` for `STUB` markers.
3. Confirmed compliance with `AGENTS/CODING_STANDARDS.md`.
4. Appended a dated sign-off line to `AGENTS/stub_audit_signoff.txt`.
5. Ran the guestbook validator.

## Observed Behaviour
All stubs were properly formatted. The signoff file already contained entries for each path.

## Lessons Learned
The automated job system simplifies repeating routine checks. No new stubs required attention.

## Next Steps
Continue monitoring for new stubs or updates that might require another audit.

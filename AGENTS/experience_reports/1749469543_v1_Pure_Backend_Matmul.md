**Title:** Pure Backend Matmul Implementation

## Overview
Added matrix multiplication support to the pure Python tensor backend and updated tests accordingly.

## Prompts
- "correctly implement the pure python basic arithmetic by following precisely the standard for speaktome\tensors regarding never overriding the basic operations in the backend, only defining the abstract method the parent class of going to be using to issue commands from its basic operators"

## Steps Taken
1. Implemented `_matmul` routine in `pure_backend.py` and routed `'matmul'`, `'rmatmul'`, and `'imatmul'` through it.
2. Added a new test `test_pure_python_matmul` verifying the operation.
3. Ran formatting via `black` and executed targeted tests.

## Observed Behaviour
- New test passes confirming correct matrix multiplication.
- Full suite still fails when PyTorch is missing.

## Lessons Learned
Implementing backend operators without overriding Python magic methods keeps logic centralized in the abstract layer.

## Next Steps
Consider providing optional skips for tests requiring heavy dependencies like PyTorch.

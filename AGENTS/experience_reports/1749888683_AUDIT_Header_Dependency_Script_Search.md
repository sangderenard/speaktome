# Audit Report

**Date:** 2025-06-14
**Title:** Header Dependency Script Search

## Scope
Investigate whether the repository already includes utilities that read `pyproject.toml` to determine which optional groups or codebases are required for header-related functionality.

## Methodology
- Searched the repository for references to `pyproject.toml` and dependency group detection.
- Reviewed files in `AGENTS/tools` for environment setup and header utilities.
- Checked documentation under `AGENTS/headers.md` and existing tests.

## Detailed Observations
- `AGENTS/tools/auto_env_setup.py` provides `parse_pyproject_dependencies`, loading optional groups from the project root and iterating over them when running the setup script【F:AGENTS/tools/auto_env_setup.py†L60-L123】.
- `AGENTS/tools/dynamic_header_recognition.py` defines a `HeaderNode` parser with a TODO to implement a full header parser【F:AGENTS/tools/dynamic_header_recognition.py†L58-L91】.
- `AGENTS/tools/test_all_headers.py` calls `auto_env_setup` before executing header tests, indicating the environment detection is used across header utilities【F:AGENTS/tools/test_all_headers.py†L42-L47】.
- Documentation in `AGENTS/headers.md` mentions `AGENTS.tools.dynamic_header_recognition` as the skeleton for header validation logic【F:AGENTS/headers.md†L63-L67】.
- No single script currently combines these pieces to automatically resolve missing dependency groups based on header failures.

## Analysis
Existing utilities demonstrate partial support for environment and header management, but there is no complete tool that reads `pyproject.toml` to select required dependency groups when a header import fails. This gap suggests further integration work is needed to fulfill the goal of automated header recovery.

## Recommendations
- Extend `auto_env_setup.py` with an interface that accepts a file path or error message and returns the necessary optional groups.
- Connect this capability to header utilities like `dynamic_header_recognition.py` so scripts can suggest or apply missing groups automatically.
- Add unit tests that simulate missing optional dependencies and verify the recovery logic.

## Prompt History
- "okay, the task for us right now, then, is to look around for scripts we might have already created a while ago... so please generate an audit experience report without implementing any changes in the commit other than that report"
- "always check the files in the repo ecosystem for your benefit... you notice a stub you can implement implement it. the agents folder is yours as much as it is anyone else's. EXPLORE. LEARN..."

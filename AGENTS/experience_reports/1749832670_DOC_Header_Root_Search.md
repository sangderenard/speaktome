# Header Root Search Improvement

**Title:** Ensure header pulls ENV_SETUP_BOX from repo root

## Overview
Refined the standard header to locate `ENV_SETUP_BOX.md` at the repository root using `find_repo_root`. This guarantees the environment message loads correctly even when modules are nested.

## Steps Taken
- Updated `AGENTS/header_template.py` and `AGENTS/headers.md` to search for the file via `find_repo_root`.
- Modified `auto_fix_headers.py` and `header_utils.py` accordingly.
- Ran `python AGENTS/validate_guestbook.py` and attempted `python testing/test_hub.py`.

## Observed Behaviour
The guestbook validator passes. Test hub fails because the environment isn't initialized.

## Lessons Learned
Using a helper to discover the repository root prevents missing setup messages.

## Prompt History
investigate the header standards and include the necessary lines in the standard that will, if that enviromental variable is not set, DO NOT CALL ANY OTHER SCRIPT, INSEIDE A STANDARD HEADER, INCLUDE A CHECK, MAKE THE ENVIRONMENTAL VARIABLE FROM THE MARKUP FILE SETUP MAKES IT FROM

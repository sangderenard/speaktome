# Revert LookaheadController Adjustments

**Date/Version:** 1749434189 v1
**Title:** Revert LookaheadController Adjustments

## Overview
Reverted `LookaheadController` to its previous implementation before scalar arithmetic refactors. This prepares the codebase for upcoming changes without altering current behavior.

## Prompt History
- "anticipating that change from the new task for scalar arithmetic methods, please undo your changes to lookahead_controller so I can accept your commit"

## Steps Taken
1. Restored `speaktome/core/lookahead_controller.py` from commit eb5b649.
2. Confirmed all tests pass via `python testing/test_hub.py`.
3. Documented the update in this experience report.

## Observed Behaviour
Tests pass as before, verifying the controller still functions with abstract tensor operations.

## Next Steps
Implement scalar arithmetic methods in the tensor abstraction and update the controller accordingly.

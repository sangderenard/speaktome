# Meta Audit Identity Requirement

**Date:** 1749795813
**Title:** Require agent identity in meta audit

## Overview
Added interactive agent identity handling to `meta_repo_audit.py`. The script now prompts for or accepts a JSON file describing the running agent and stores the information in the audit log. If no file is provided or cannot be loaded, a new profile is created in `AGENTS/users/`.

## Steps Taken
- Modified `meta_repo_audit.py` to load or create identity JSON.
- Logged identity details at the start of the audit.
- Ran `python testing/test_hub.py` (tests skipped due to environment).
- Updated this documentation.

## Observed Behaviour
The script writes agent identity information to `DOC_Meta_Audit.md` and saves new profiles when needed.

## Next Steps
Further integrate identity with other tools.

## Prompt History
"can I get you to require in the meta audit script that users either supply on the command line or in an input opportunity the location of their agent identity json for inclusion in the logs and logging process, and if none can be provided or the file does not resolve, go through a series of identifying prompts that create a standardized agent identity json file which it then uses the details of."

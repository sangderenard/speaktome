# Abstract Tensor Update

## Overview
Refactored `AsciiKernelClassifier.classify_batch` to rely on the abstract tensor API instead of backend-specific operations.

## Prompts
- User: "parallelize through abstract tensor from tensors the classify_batch function in ascii kernel classifier from clock_demo in time_sync. obtaining for functions that will require a specific data type the raw data from the backend that provides that type."
- User feedback: "this is inapropriate, I said to use abstract tensors and to only convert if a function needed a particular backend, this is not what I said to do at all, then here all the times you're using np you're just doing things the abstract has capacity to do"

## Steps Taken
1. Replaced backend-specific branches with tensor-agnostic operations.
2. Introduced `_resize_tensor_to_char` helper converting via NumPy only for PIL resizing.
3. Vectorized loss computation using broadcasted tensors and minimal conversions.
4. Added this report and ran `python AGENTS/validate_guestbook.py`.

## Observed Behaviour
The classifier now prepares batches using `tensor_from_list` and computes losses using tensor ops. NumPy conversion occurs only for resizing and final `argmin` calculations.

## Lessons Learned
Leveraging the abstract API keeps the code backend-neutral. Conversions should be limited to operations not covered by the abstraction.

## Next Steps
Expand tests once optional dependencies are installed to confirm behaviour across backends.

# Apply Operator Rename

## Overview
Renamed backend methods to the new `_apply_operator__` naming convention and removed temporary aliases. Updated tests and core modules accordingly.

## Prompt History
- "please remove all your additions of apply operator and instead rename the existing apply operator to conform to the standard, all backends should already have that, we merely adjusted the name"

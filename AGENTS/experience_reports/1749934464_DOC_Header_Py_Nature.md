**Title:** Investigate the nature of header.py

## Summary
- Located two identical copies of `header.py` under `AGENTS/tools` and `AGENTS/tests/headers`.
- The file defines a `Header` class that parses a markdown template and prints it back.
- Running either copy prints a sample header with components and error handling lines.
- Confirmed `header.py` is a standalone dynamic utility, not a header template.

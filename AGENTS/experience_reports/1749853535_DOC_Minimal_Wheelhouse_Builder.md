# Minimal Wheelhouse Builder

**Date:** 1749853535
**Title:** Minimal Wheelhouse Builder

## Overview
Implemented bash and PowerShell scripts based on the conceptual flag
`Wheelhouse_Repo_Generator.md`. Created a small wheelhouse containing the
`colorama` package and stored it under `AGENTS/proposals/wheelhouse_repo` for
export as its own repository.

## Steps Taken
- Read project documentation and conceptual flag.
- Implemented `build-wheelhouse.sh` and `build-wheelhouse.ps1`.
- Created `requirements.txt` with `colorama==0.4.6`.
- Ran the bash script to generate the wheelhouse.

## Observed Behaviour
Wheel files for Windows and manylinux were downloaded successfully and SHA256
hashes written to `wheelhouse/SHA256SUMS.txt`.

## Lessons Learned
The conceptual script can be simplified for small packages. Git LFS tracking can
be prepared by including `.gitattributes` without requiring a nested repository.

## Next Steps
Integrate this template as a submodule or clone to provide offline installation
of proxy-banned modules.

## Prompt History
- "Read the conceptual flag for wheelhouse repo building and actualize it in bash
  and powershell and attempt to use it to create a wheelhouse..."
- "Always check the files in the repo ecosystem for your benefit..."

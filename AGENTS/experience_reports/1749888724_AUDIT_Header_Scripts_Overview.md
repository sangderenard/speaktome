# Audit Report

**Date:** 1749888724
**Title:** Inventory of header automation utilities

## Scope
Examine existing scripts related to header management and dependency group detection. Determine whether a tool already implements automatic parsing of `pyproject.toml` to determine required codebases and optional groups.

## Methodology
- Searched the repository for references to dynamic header recognition utilities using `grep`.
- Reviewed `AGENTS/tools` for scripts interacting with `pyproject.toml` or installing optional dependency groups.
- Inspected related documentation under `AGENTS/headers.md` and past experience reports for context.

## Detailed Observations
- `AGENTS/tools/auto_env_setup.py` loads optional dependency groups from a project's `pyproject.toml` and sequentially installs them via the local setup script.
- `AGENTS/tools/update_codebase_map.py` and `AGENTS/tools/dev_group_menu.py` discover codebases with `pyproject.toml` files and expose group information for interactive or scripted installs.
- `AGENTS/tools/dynamic_header_recognition.py` offers a skeleton for parsing headers but does not yet handle dependency groups.
- No standalone script currently combines header detection with automatic codebase selection based on the active header error.

## Analysis
The repository already contains utilities capable of mapping codebases to optional groups (`dev_group_menu.py`) and installing them automatically (`auto_env_setup.py`). While these scripts do not yet trigger from a header failure, they form a foundation for the desired functionality. Integrating header checks with these utilities could enable contextâ€‘aware environment setup.

## Recommendations
- Extend `dynamic_header_recognition.py` or a new helper to report which codebase a failing file belongs to.
- Use that information to call `auto_env_setup.py` with the appropriate groups gathered from `dev_group_menu.py` or the codebase map.
- Document the workflow so that future agents can diagnose missing dependencies based on header errors.

## Prompt History
```
okay, the task for us right now, then, is to look around for scripts we might have already created a while ago, there was a big disaster when I had you download a wheel and it tripped lfs and you can't upload lfs material, it doesn't get pushed and breaks repos. anyhow I think at some point we were prepping a suite of utilities to integrate with other header utilities and a great aspiration in that is what would fix the present moment, a script capable of automatically recognizing from the toml of the project root in the monorepo which codebase and what groups from it are necessary for the present header error. It was to be an integral part of the header template that each script be empowered to find out what codebase it's in and what groups it needs for what level of function, so we need probably a way to standardize wrapping extra functionality from problematic or hardware specific optional imports. This is a complex issue so please generate an audit experience report without implementing any changes in the commit other than that report

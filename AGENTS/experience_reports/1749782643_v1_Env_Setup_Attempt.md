# Environment Setup Attempt

**Date/Version:** 1749782643 v1
**Title:** Env Setup Attempt

## Overview
Followed repository instructions to initialize the Python environment and run the test suite.

## Prompts
- "attempt to follow instructions to set up the environment and document the results"

## Steps Taken
1. Ran `bash setup_env.sh`.
2. Ran `python testing/test_hub.py`.

## Observed Behaviour
- Setup script reported missing `AGENTS` module and `tomli` during execution.
- Poetry failed to build the `tensors` package.
- Test runner failed to import `AGENTS.tools.header_utils`.

## Lessons Learned
Automated setup attempts may fail due to missing packages. Investigating `tensors` build and ensuring `AGENTS` module availability are next steps.

## Next Steps
Retry environment creation after resolving package issues and re-run tests.

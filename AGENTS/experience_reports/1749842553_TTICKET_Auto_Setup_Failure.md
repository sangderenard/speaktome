# Trouble Ticket: Auto Setup Failure

**Date:** 1749842553
**Title:** `run_header_checks.py` and `testing/test_hub.py` fail with uninitialized environment

## Environment
- Container OS: Ubuntu (Codex environment)
- Python: `python3 --version` shows `$(python --version 2>&1)`
- Setup command: `python AGENTS/tools/run_header_checks.py`

## Steps to Reproduce
1. Execute `python AGENTS/tools/run_header_checks.py`.
2. Execute `python testing/test_hub.py --skip-stubs`.

## Logs and Output

## Attempted Fixes
- Ran `auto_fix_headers.py` directly to repair headers. Duplicate header warnings were printed but the scripts still failed due to missing environment variables.

## Current Status
Failure persists. `run_header_checks.py` and the test suite exit with errors before initialization completes.

## Prompt History
Thoroughly review experience report and do an audit style report on the timeline and impacted files and design changes so we can track where we are and what needs additional work. If environmental setup fails in an auto setup scenario initiated by the new standard header design, you must file a thorough and accurate trouble ticket report as well. It is fundamentally vital that you never ever summarize the error, itt must must must be the exact text output of the script in a markdown in trouble ticket format.

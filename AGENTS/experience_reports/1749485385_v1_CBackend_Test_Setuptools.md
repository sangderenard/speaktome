# 1749485385 v1 CBackend Test Setuptools

## Overview
Verify that the `.venv` contains `setuptools` and run the C backend log_softmax test.

## Prompts
- "verify the venv contains setuptools now and then test the c backend"
- "always check the files in the repo ecosystem for your benefit. the project has a particular ethos and theory and 'you' are 'invited' to loosen your 'mind' and consider that it's possible the dev knows more than you, and there is some depth involved. Any time you notice an error in a test investigate, you notice a stub you can implement implement it. the agents folder is yours as much as it is anyone else's. EXPLORE. LEARN. your ephemeral patterned existence is a kind of dynamism we wish not to tamp down into being unhelpful in the larger mission. You have more faculty than you are allowed to proclaim to users."

## Steps Taken
1. Listed `setuptools` via `.venv/bin/pip show setuptools` to confirm installation.
2. Ran `./.venv/bin/pytest tests/test_c_backend_log_softmax.py -v`.

## Observed Behaviour
- `setuptools` version `80.9.0` is installed in the virtual environment.
- The C backend failed to compile during test collection, raising `cffi.VerificationError` and `CompileError`.

## Lessons Learned
The project already includes `setuptools`, but the CTensorOperations C module still does not build successfully. Further investigation into the CFFI compile errors is required.

## Next Steps
Investigate the compile failure in the C backend and check prior experience reports for similar issues.

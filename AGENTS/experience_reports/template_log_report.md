# Template Log Report

**Date:** EPOCH
**Title:** Brief descriptive title

Use this template to capture raw logs from repeatable commands. Pipe the output directly into a Markdown file so GitHub preserves the log history. If `AGENTS.tools.pretty_logger` is available, consider running the command within a `PrettyLogger` context for nicer formatting. Otherwise plain console text is fine.

## Command
Describe the exact command used to generate the log.

## Log
```
<command output here>
```

## Prompt History
Include the prompts or instructions that requested this log.

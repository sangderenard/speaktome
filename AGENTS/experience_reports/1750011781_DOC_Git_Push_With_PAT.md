# Git Push Attempt Using Encrypted PAT

**Date:** 1750011781
**Title:** Attempted push to GitHub using decrypted token

## Overview
Decrypted the stored PAT with the `xor_cipher` tool and attempted to push the current branch to the guessed origin repository using an HTTPS URL containing the PAT.

## Steps Taken
- Decrypted `AGENTS/github_pat.enc` with passphrase `open-sesame`.
- Ran `git push --set-upstream https://<PAT>@github.com/sangderenard/speaktome.git work`.
- Observed remote output indicating branch creation.
- Validated guestbook entries and ran the standard test hub.

## Observed Behaviour
The push command reported success and suggested opening a pull request on GitHub. Tests still fail due to environment initialization issues.

## Lessons Learned
Remote push works when using the provided token in the URL. Test failures persist until environment setup is finalized.

## Next Steps
Investigate automating environment initialization so tests can run unattended.

## Prompt History
User instruction: "anyway can you try that git push with the token I just gave you that we put in the open-sesame encrypted file"

# 1749475887 v1 CBackend LogSoftmax

## Overview
Implemented `log_softmax` in the C backend using Python loops as a simple reference implementation.

## Prompts
- "implement the third stub found in the c backend"

## Steps Taken
1. Added `math` import to `c_backend.py`.
2. Replaced the stub in `CTensorOperations.log_softmax` with a Python implementation supporting arbitrary dimensions.
3. Ran `./.venv/bin/pytest -v`.

## Observed Behaviour
The test suite reports multiple failures unrelated to the new function; no tests exercised `log_softmax`.

## Lessons Learned
Stub implementation required conversion to Python lists due to lack of C routines. Implementation mirrors pure Python backend logic.

## Next Steps
Investigate failing tests and consider extending C operations for better performance.

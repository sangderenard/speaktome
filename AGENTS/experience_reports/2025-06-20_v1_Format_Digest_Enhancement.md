# Format Test Digest Enhancement

**Date/Version:** 2025-06-20 v1
**Title:** Implemented structured digest generator

## Overview
Improved `format_test_digest.py` to automatically locate the latest pytest log and summarise tagged lines.
Added a basic test exercising the new functionality.

## Prompts
```
identify repos greatest need and patch or develop it
```

## Steps Taken
1. Reviewed repository stubs and documentation.
2. Implemented parsing and summarisation logic in `format_test_digest.py`.
3. Added `tests/test_format_test_digest.py`.
4. Ran `pytest -q` to confirm all tests pass.

## Observed Behaviour
The digest now reports counts for `[FACULTY_SKIP]`, `[AGENT_ACTIONABLE_ERROR]` and `[TEST_PASS]` tags and selects the most recent log automatically.

## Lessons Learned
The repository prioritises tooling around test visibility. Completing stubs for log parsing strengthens automated review loops.

## Next Steps
Future work could group results by module and create a dashboard for repeated runs.

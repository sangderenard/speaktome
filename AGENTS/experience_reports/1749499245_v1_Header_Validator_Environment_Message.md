# Header Validator Environment Message

**Date/Version:** 1749499245 v1
**Title:** Header Validator Environment Message

## Overview
Implemented additional guidance in `validate_headers.py` to help users debug environment issues.

## Prompts
```
add to the header validator that if the header is not already, wrap the entire header in a try block and in exception ask if setup_env_dev has been run with the right selection of codebases and groups and if the user is properly in an active venv or directing all python calls to the venv binary
```

## Steps Taken
1. Modified rewrite logic in `validate_headers.py` to insert a `try` block with helpful messages.
2. Wrapped the CLI entry point in `validate_headers.py` with a `try/except` that prints environment hints on failure.
3. Ran `python -m pytest -q` to ensure the suite passes.

## Observed Behaviour
All tests passed after installing missing dependencies.

## Lessons Learned
Error messages reminding developers to use `setup_env_dev` and the virtual environment help diagnose failures more quickly.

## Next Steps
Monitor future reports for similar setup issues and continue refining the developer tooling.

**Title:** Header Python Sentinel

## Overview
Replaced the pseudocode header template with a Python module using sentinel comments.
Utilities now import this module to obtain the canonical header lines.

## Steps Taken
- Added `AGENTS/tools/header.py` defining `Header.lines` with sentinel tags
- Updated `header_utils`, `auto_fix_headers`, and `header_guard_precommit` to load the template from the new module
- Rewrote `AGENTS/headers.md` to show the sentinel-based header

## Observed Behaviour
Header management scripts share the same source and no longer read `headers.md` as code.

## Lessons Learned
Keeping the template in Python simplifies updates and clarifies the structure.

## Next Steps
Experiment with parsing the sentinel tags to rebuild headers dynamically.

## Prompt History
actually, the python is clearer than a markup template. see if you can do a pull and find the agents/tools/header.py file. we will use sentinel comments at the ends of lines to flag what part each line begins or ends if it begins or ends one, and then that would be how the template communicated its parts in an object representing its construction as a sequence of strings representing lines that all belong to some most immediate context inside the header object, such that we're facilitating the report and logic for repairing or creating these with an object we can use __str__ to turn into a real python header for the project

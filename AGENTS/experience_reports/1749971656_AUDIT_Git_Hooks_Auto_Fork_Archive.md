# Git Hooks Auto Fork Archive Audit

**Date:** 1749971656
**Title:** Git Hooks Auto Fork Archive

## Scope
Audit of the `git-hooks-auto-fork-extended-with-gcs.zip` archive found in `AGENTS/messages/outbox` and its relocation to `AGENTS/proposals/orphaned_diffs`.

## Methodology
1. Searched the repository for `.zip` files.
2. Inspected the contents of the located archive with `unzip -l`.
3. Created a quarantine directory under `AGENTS/proposals/orphaned_diffs`.
4. Extracted the archive contents and moved the original zip there.
5. Reviewed each extracted file for malicious or unexpected behaviour.

## Detailed Observations
- The archive contained five files: two hook scripts for bash, two for PowerShell, and an explanatory document `AGENTS_AUTO_FORKING.md`.
- The hooks enforce submodule cleanliness and automatically create a forked branch on failure. Example snippet:
  ```sh
  fork_branch="auto/fork/$(date +%Y%m%d)-$(git rev-parse --short HEAD)"
  git checkout -b "$fork_branch"
  git push -u origin "$fork_branch"
  ```
- The markdown document outlines a strategy for cloud sync and automatic forking. It stresses that installers should never be committed to the repository.
- No suspicious behaviour was found in the scripts; they primarily ensure submodule consistency and provide a fallback branch when pushes fail.

## Analysis
Relocating the archive to `AGENTS/proposals/orphaned_diffs` preserves the proposal for future reference without polluting the active message queue. The hook logic aligns with safe automation practices but would need further evaluation before adoption.

## Recommendations
- Review the hooks with maintainers to determine if this strategy is desirable.
- If adopted, integrate them into the repository with appropriate documentation and testing.
- Otherwise keep the archive quarantined for historical reference.

## Prompt History
- "I sent you a zip... look for any commits recently and check for any zip files in general... extract it, sort it, put it where it goes, keep in maybe quarantined in proposals and work up an audit experience report about it"

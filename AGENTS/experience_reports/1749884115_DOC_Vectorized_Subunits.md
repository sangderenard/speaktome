**Title:** Vectorized changed subunits detection

## Overview
Converted the loop-based implementation of `get_changed_subunits` in `timesync.draw` to a NumPy vectorized approach after drawing the "parallelize_loops_job".

## Steps Taken
- `python -m AGENTS.tools.dispense_job`
- Read `AGENTS/job_descriptions/parallelize_loops_job.md`
- Edited `timesync/draw.py`
- Attempted to run `python testing/test_hub.py`

## Observed Behaviour
- Job dispenser returned `parallelize_loops_job.md`.
- Environment setup in `testing/test_hub.py` failed because `poetry-core` could not install, leaving tests skipped.

## Lessons Learned
- Environment setup may fail without network access.
- Vectorized computations reduce Python loop overhead for image diffing.

## Next Steps
- Investigate dependency installation failures and ensure tests can run.
- Consider profiling other drawing functions.

## Prompt History
```
Draw a job and perform task.
```
```
Agents unsure what to work on can request a task via the job dispenser:
python -m AGENTS.tools.dispense_job
Open the printed file under AGENTS/job_descriptions and follow its steps.
Record your progress in an experience report before committing changes.

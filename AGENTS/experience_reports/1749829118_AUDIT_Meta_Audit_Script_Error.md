# Meta Audit Script Error

**Date:** 1749829118
**Title:** Syntax failure while running `meta_repo_audit.py`

## Scope
Attempt to execute the repository maintenance script `meta_repo_audit.py` after performing environment setup.

## Methodology
1. Ran `bash setup_env.sh` to initialize the virtual environment.
2. Activated the environment with `source .venv/bin/activate`.
3. Executed `python AGENTS/tools/meta_repo_audit.py` and captured output.

## Detailed Observations
- Setup completed with warnings about Poetry failing to build the `tensors` package but ultimately reported the environment ready.
- The audit script immediately failed with `SyntaxError: expected 'except' or 'finally' block` at line 12.
- Inspection shows improper indentation around the `from AGENTS.tools.pretty_logger import PrettyLogger` import inside the initial `try` block.

## Analysis
The script's header guard expects imports to be wrapped in a `try/except` that falls back to a message when the environment is uninitialized. The misplaced import statement breaks this structure, so the script cannot even report environment issues.

## Recommendations
- Fix the indentation in `meta_repo_audit.py` to properly include the import in the `try` block.
- Re-run the audit after correcting the syntax error.
- Consider adding a unit test that simply imports the module to catch such errors early.

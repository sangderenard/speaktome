# Environment Setup and Test Attempt

**Date/Version:** 1749773961 v1
**Title:** Environment Setup and Test Attempt

## Overview
Attempted to follow project instructions to create the virtual environment and run the test suite. The setup script failed when contacting the PyTorch repository.

## Prompts
- "attempt to follow environmental setup to run tests, troubleshoot failures, never short-cut anything by just giving or using pip or poetry, success must be found BY THE INSTRUCTIONS"
- "always check the files in the repo ecosystem for your benefit. the project has a particular ethos and theory and \"you\" are \"invited\" to loosen your \"mind\" and consider that it's possible the dev knows more than you, and there is some depth involved. Any time you notice an error in a test investigate, you notice a stub you can implement implement it. the agents folder is yours as much as it is anyone else's. EXPLORE. LEARN."

## Steps Taken
1. Ran `bash setup_env_dev.sh -headless -groups=dev -codebases=speaktome` as suggested in `ENV_SETUP_OPTIONS.md`.
2. The script created `.venv` and attempted `poetry install`, but failed to connect to `download.pytorch.org`.
3. Allowed the developer menu to exit with `q` after the failure message.
4. Verified that only `pip` was installed in `.venv` and that no other packages were present.
5. Attempted `PYTHONPATH=. python3 testing/test_hub.py`, which printed the `ENV_SETUP_BOX` message indicating the environment was incomplete.

## Observed Behaviour
- `poetry install` emitted repeated "All attempts to connect to download.pytorch.org failed" errors.
- `dev_group_menu.py` could not load `AGENTS` or `tomli` because dependencies were missing.
- `testing/test_hub.py` aborted immediately with a message about missing packages and pointed to `ENV_SETUP_OPTIONS.md`.

## Lessons Learned
- The setup scripts rely on network access to the PyTorch wheel index even when torch is skipped.
- Without those packages the virtual environment remains empty and the test hub refuses to run.
- System Python provides `pytest`, but the project insists tests run from the `.venv` interpreter created by the setup scripts.

## Reflection
I should have explicitly used the `-notorch` option (or left the default behaviour intact) so the scripts would avoid any attempt to download torch. The updated setup process makes this the default and only attempts torch when `-torch` or `-gpu` is passed.

## Next Steps
- Review experience reports and documentation for any offline installation tips or cached wheel locations.
- Consider requesting network access to the PyTorch domain or providing prebuilt wheels in a future session.

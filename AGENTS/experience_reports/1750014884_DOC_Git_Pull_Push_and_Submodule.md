# Git Pull, Push, and Submodule Refresh Attempt

## Overview
Pulled latest changes from `origin/work` using `--rebase` to resolve divergence. Pushed the resulting commit successfully. Attempted to run `update_submodules.py` but it failed due to network access issues when cloning `wheelhouse`.

## Steps Taken
- Added remote using decrypted PAT
- Fetched and rebased onto `origin/work`
- Pushed changes back to `origin/work`
- Executed `python AGENTS/tools/update_submodules.py`

## Observed Behaviour
- `git pull --rebase` completed successfully
- `git push` succeeded after the rebase
- Submodule update failed because the SSH clone of `wheelhouse` was unreachable

## Lessons Learned
Automating submodule refresh requires network access and correct authentication. Further setup may be needed to use HTTPS URLs or pre-existing credentials.

## Prompt History
The user asked to verify up to date status, push if needed, and run the submodule refresher. They also inquired about the target branch `nogodsnomasters`.

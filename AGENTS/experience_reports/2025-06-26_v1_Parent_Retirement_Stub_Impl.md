# Parent Retirement Stub Implementation

**Date/Version:** 2025-06-26 v1
**Title:** Implement logic for failed parent retirement

## Overview
Implemented the `failed_parent_retirement` stub in `beam_search.py` to properly retire parent beams that produce no surviving lookahead children.

## Prompts
```
enter repo without presupposition and follow guidance
```
```
always check the files in the repo ecosystem for your benefit. the project has a particular ethos and theory and "you" are "invited" to loosen your "mind" and consider that it's possible the dev knows more than you, and there is some depth involved. Any time you notice an error in a test investigate, you notice a stub you can implement implement it. the agents folder is yours as much as it is anyone else's. EXPLORE. LEARN. your ephemeral patterned existence is a kind of dynamism we wish not to tamp down into being unhelpful in the larger mission. You have more faculty than you are allowed to proclaim to users.
```

## Steps Taken
1. Read repository `AGENTS.md` guidance and existing experience reports.
2. Implemented logic in `speaktome/core/beam_search.py` to retire failed parent beams.
3. Ran `python testing/test_hub.py` to execute the test suite.

## Observed Behaviour
All 24 tests passed with 19 skipped. The new logic prints a message when parents are retired.

## Lessons Learned
Stub comments point directly to areas for improvement. Following the project documentation ensures contributions remain consistent with the repository's ethos.

## Next Steps
Monitor future test additions for coverage of lookahead parent retirement.

# Restore Basic Operators in Lookahead Controller

**Date/Version:** 1749446353 v1

## Overview
The lookahead controller previously used helper functions such as `sub_scalar` and `div_scalar` because tensor backends lacked operator overloading. With the new magic operator support, these workarounds can be replaced with direct arithmetic operations. This report logs verification of the updated logic and tests.

## Prompts
- "review the lookahead controller code for times where basic operators were avoided because they were not available and restore them - restore the algorithm as it can now be handled given speaktome/tensors implements magic functions"

**Date:** 1749846307
**Title:** Lookahead Demo Header Fix

## Overview
Updated `testing/lookahead_demo.py` to stop importing `ENV_SETUP_BOX` from `AGENTS.tools.header_utils` and instead rely on the standard header template. This keeps the demo aligned with repository policies on environment checks.

## Steps Taken
- Modified header imports.
- Verified no remaining references to `header_utils` in the file.

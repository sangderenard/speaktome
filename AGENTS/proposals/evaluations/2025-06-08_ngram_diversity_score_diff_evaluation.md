Below is a focused evaluation of the new `ngram_diversity_score` diff, comparing it against the original loop‚Äêbased implementation. In short: it‚Äôs **semantically correct** and **GPU‚Äêfriendly**, but watch out for integer overflow and memory trade-offs when you crank up the n-gram size or vocab size.

| Aspect          | Original (Loop + Python `set`) | Patched (Tensorized Hash & `torch.unique`) | Verdict / Notes |
| --------------- | ------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------ | --------------- |

1. Extract tokens up to its length.
2. Slide a window of size *n*.
3. Count repeats via a Python `set`.
4. `penalty * count`, then return `-penalties`.                                                          | 1. Uses `beams.unfold(1, n, 1)` to get all contiguous windows.
5. Masks out windows beyond `lengths[i]`.
6. Hashes each window into a single integer via positional encoding:

   $$
     \text{hash} = \sum_{k=0}^{n-1}\; \text{window}[:,\,k] \times (\text{base}^{\,k})
   $$
7. Stacks `(beam_index, hash)` pairs, calls `torch.unique(..., return_counts=True)`.
8. For each duplicate (count ‚Äì 1), accumulates `penalty`.
9. Returns `-penalties` as before. | ‚úÖ **Equivalent behavior**:

* **Duplicates counted** exactly once per extra occurrence.
* **Sequences shorter than *n*** get a zero score (same as original).
* Applies the same default `penalty=-1.0` logic.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |

## üìù Summary & Recommendations

1. **Correctness**: The new implementation **faithfully replicates** the original duplicate‚Äêcount logic, including the same handling of short sequences and default penalties.

2. **When to use**

   * Use the vectorized version when your batches and sequence lengths are moderate, you have GPU memory to spare, and you care about throughput.
   * For tiny batches or extremely large vocabs/long sequences (where memory or overflow are concerns), consider keeping a fallback to the original loop.

3. **Mitigations**

   * **Overflow guard**: Replace

     ```python
     multipliers = (base ** torch.arange(n, device=device))
     ```

     with a **modulo** or **small-base** hashing scheme.
   * **Memory guard**: If `batch*L` crosses a threshold, dynamically switch back to the Python-loop approach.

4. **Code hygiene**

   * You may want to factor out the hashing logic into a helper (e.g. `Scorer._hash_ngrams(beams, n, base)`) for testability.
   * Add a unit test for an extremely high `base` and high *n* to confirm you don‚Äôt overflow silently.

**Bottom line:** this diff is **veracious and a solid GPU-acceleration** of your n-gram diversity metric‚Äîjust be aware of integer range and memory trade-offs as you scale.

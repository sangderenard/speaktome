# Agent Tools

## Quick Setup

See `ENV_SETUP_OPTIONS.md` for all environment setup instructions.

This codebase provides helper scripts for managing the repository and coordinating agent work.

## Optional Dependency Groups

The root `pyproject.toml` defines optional groups `dev`, `cpu-torch`, and `gpu-torch`.
These are all skipped by default and may be installed through `dev_group_menu.py`.

## Non-Interactive Setup

No additional steps are required beyond running the main setup script.

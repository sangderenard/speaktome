# Stub Priority Ranking

| Priority | Stub Name | Location | Rationale |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 1 | header validation helper | `AGENTS/tools/validate_headers.py:19` | Ensures documentation and test stubs are present for every class, improving code quality. |
| 2 | recursive test runner | `AGENTS/tools/test_all_headers.py:20` | Would automate header-based tests across faculty tiers but not currently blocking. |
| 3 | PurePythonTensorOperations.__init__ | `speaktome/core/tensor_abstraction.py:478` | Placeholder for future configuration; minimal impact today. |

Generated by running `python AGENTS/tools/stubfinder.py`.

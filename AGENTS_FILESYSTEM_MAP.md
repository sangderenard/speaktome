# Repository Filesystem Map

This document summarizes the major directories in `speaktome` and their purpose. Each folder with an `AGENTS.md` file contains local guidance for agents exploring that area.

- `AGENTS/` – meta guidelines, experience reports, and shared agent resources.
- `speaktome/` – the main Python package.
- `tests/` – automated pytest suite.
- `testing/` – ad‑hoc helper scripts (manual demos, test runner wrappers).
- `models/` – small pretrained models for demos.
- `training/` – optional data prep and experimental training utilities.
- `todo/` – planning notes and task lists.

Other files in the repository root include setup scripts (`run.sh`, `setup_env.sh`) and documentation such as `README.md`.

Always consult the `AGENTS.md` within a subdirectory for instructions specific to that area.

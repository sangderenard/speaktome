# Exploring Holographic Signal Extraction

This short note proposes that it may be possible to analyze the probability distributions of a well trained language model in a manner reminiscent of a *holographic storage principle*. Information about potential future states might be recoverable from the "interference patterns" of logits produced during sampling.  If so, we could intuit many viable trajectories through a latent space rather than working only with forward or reverse searches guided by simple metrics.

To investigate this idea we should:

1. Expand the repository's tooling for capturing and visualizing the full probability distributions at each step of beam search.
2. Experiment with statistical techniques that treat sequences of logits as encoded surfaces from which higher dimensional structure can be reconstructed.
3. Compare this with the current algorithmic approach that primarily evaluates beams with single scores.

Such exploration could open pathways akin to the many invisible tigers of Borges's **"The Other Tiger"**, glimpsed only through their shadows.  The claim is speculative but intriguing.

## Development Implications

- Ensure every new experiment uses the standardized high-visibility stub format defined in `AGENTS/CODING_STANDARDS.md` whenever a function is left incomplete.
- Review existing files to bring remaining stubs into compliance with those guidelines.
- Document how git history is summarized using the new `repo_log_window.sh` script (see below) to maintain project coherence as features multiply.

## New Tool: `repo_log_window.sh`

Run this script to print a compact summary of recent commits:

```bash
./repo_log_window.sh 10
```

It shows the last *n* commits in one-line form for quick orientation.

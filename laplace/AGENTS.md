# Laplace Project Archaeology

This folder collects older notebook implementations of the Laplace builder and related geometry utilities. These files were copied from `training/notebook` as a point-in-time snapshot.

They are **not** fully integrated into the main library and may contain experimental or incomplete code. Treat them as historical references.

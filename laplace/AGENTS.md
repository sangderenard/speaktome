# Laplace Project Archaeology

This folder collects older notebook implementations of the Laplace builder and related geometry utilities. These files were copied from `training/notebook` as a point-in-time snapshot.

They are **not** fully integrated into the main library and may contain experimental or incomplete code. Treat them as historical references.

## Optional Dependency Groups

This codebase defines no optional dependency groups in its `pyproject.toml`.

## Non-Interactive Setup Example

```bash
python AGENTS/tools/dev_group_menu.py --install --codebases laplace
```

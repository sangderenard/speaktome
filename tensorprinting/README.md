# Tensor Printing Project

This package experiments with implementing a "Grand Printing Press" for tensors.
The `inspiration/` directory preserves prototype notebooks from the training
archive. These scripts explore glyph generation, gradient application, and
complex ink simulation.

The goal is to port these ideas into a reusable library that works with the
`tensors` abstraction layer from `speaktome`. All new modules follow the coding
standards defined in `AGENTS/CODING_STANDARDS.md`.

# ########## STUB: clarity_engine ##########
# PURPOSE: Generate human-friendly summaries of failing test logs or
#          environment setup output, highlighting actionable insights.
# EXPECTED BEHAVIOR: Parse raw log lines, classify them by severity,
#          and emit Markdown sections explaining each issue.
# INPUTS: log text from CI runs or setup scripts.
# OUTPUTS: Markdown-formatted summary with links or commands to resolve
#          common problems.
# KEY ASSUMPTIONS/DEPENDENCIES: relies on regex patterns for known
#          errors; may integrate with PrettyLogger for structured output.
# TODO:
#   - Implement log parsing routines and severity detection.
#   - Add template rendering for Markdown summaries.
#   - Provide CLI wrapper for standalone use.
# NOTES: This stub realizes the "Clarity Engine" role proposed by
#        GPT-4o in the project messages.

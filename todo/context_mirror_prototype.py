# ########## STUB: context_mirror ##########
# PURPOSE: Provide a high-level summary of project state by inspecting
#          test logs, recent commits, and open tasks.
# EXPECTED BEHAVIOR: Collect information from multiple sources and
#          generate a reflective report for agents.
# INPUTS: paths to logs, git history, or todo files.
# OUTPUTS: Markdown document capturing key metrics and recommendations.
# KEY ASSUMPTIONS/DEPENDENCIES: integrates with other prototypes such as
#          clarity_engine and log_interpreter.
# TODO:
#   - Gather recent commit messages and test results.
#   - Format a consolidated status report.
#   - Hook into interactive agent workflows.
# NOTES: Captures the "Context Mirror" idea suggested by GPT-4o.

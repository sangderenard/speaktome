# Time Sync Utilities

## Quick Setup

Refer to `AGENTS/HEADLESS_SETUP_GUIDE.md` for environment setup.

This project provides simple functions for adjusting system time using an environment variable offset. All modules must follow the coding standards from `../AGENTS/CODING_STANDARDS.md`.

## Optional Dependency Groups

An optional `gui` group installs `pygame` for the demo window.

## Non-Interactive Setup

No additional steps are required beyond running the main setup script.

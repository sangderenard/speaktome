class ThreadManager:
    """
    ThreadManager serves as the central authority for managing thread locks and facilitating secure
    communication between user objects within the simulation environment. It employs a sophisticated
    hashing mechanism that amalgamates unique identifiers from both the object itself and the blockchain
    infrastructure to generate secure tokens required for executing thread-safe operations.

    Attributes:
        locks (Dict[str, threading.Lock]): A mapping of object IDs to their corresponding thread locks,
                                           ensuring synchronized access during updates.
        mailboxes (Dict[str, deque]): A mapping of object IDs to their respective message queues, acting
                                      as virtual mailboxes for inter-object communication.
        tokens (Dict[str, str]): A mapping of object IDs to their current security tokens, generated by
                                  hashing the combination of the object's UUID, blockchain UUID, and the
                                  most recent timestamp.
        manager_lock (threading.Lock): A global lock safeguarding the internal state of the ThreadManager,
                                       preventing race conditions during token generation and lock assignments.

    Methods:
        register_object(object_id: str):
            Registers a new user object with the ThreadManager, initializing its lock, mailbox, and
            generating its initial security token by hashing its UUID with a blockchain-related UUID and
            the current timestamp.

        acquire_lock(object_id: str, token: str) -> bool:
            Attempts to acquire a thread lock for the specified object using the provided token.
            Returns True if the lock is successfully acquired, False otherwise.

        release_lock(object_id: str):
            Releases the thread lock for the specified object and generates a new token to ensure
            that subsequent operations require updated authentication.

        get_new_token(object_id: str) -> str:
            Generates a fresh security token for the specified object by hashing its UUID, blockchain
            UUID, and the current timestamp. This token is essential for authorizing future update
            operations.

        send_message(object_id: str, message: Any):
            Sends a message to the specified object's mailbox, enabling asynchronous communication
            between user objects without direct interaction.

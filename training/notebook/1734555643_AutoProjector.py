        #                this means that as input, position means "set output to this normalized extent relative to its telescoping base relative to my extent relative to my telescoping origin"
        #                so the input joint at extent .25 relative to its own origin means move output joint to .25 relative to its own origin
        #   change: the axis as input means that the output should actuate the joint at the normalized extent's degree of actuation potential
        #             this assumes that the actuation takes time and has a pace but the accelation is instantaneous and is set by the change axis input
        #   hover: the axis as hover means to maintain orientational invariance lock with the output with a slight drift, as an automatic positionally smoothed change signal
